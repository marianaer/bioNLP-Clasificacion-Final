24272778	53	Together with a bioinformatic analysis of other Enterobacteriaceae species , these data identify a conserved AraC regulon that includes 7 previously described AraC - regulated genes ( araB , araA , araD , araE , araF , araG , and araH ) as well as three novel targets identified in this work ( ytfQ , araT , and araU ) .

24272778	213	Thus , ydeNM is a novel AraC - regulated operon that is directly repressed by AraC in an arabinose - dependent manner .	RI
24272778	229	We did not detect any significant differences in RNAP association , suggesting that under these growth conditions , AraC does not regulate expression of a transcript that initiates within dcp .	RI
24272778	320	With the exception of xylA , the last AraC - regulated gene to be identified was araJ , more than 30 years ago ( 27 ) .	RI
24272778	328	Specifically , we identified AraC binding sites that ( i ) repress rather than activate transcription in an arabinose - dependent manner ( ydeN ) , ( ii ) result in little or no observed regulation under standard laboratory growth conditions ( ytfQ and dcp ) , and ( iii ) are located within a gene ( dcp ) .	RI
24272778	329	We also identified AraC - regulated genes that are transcribed due to read - through of inefficient Rho - independent terminators ( ygeA and polB ) .	RI
24272778	341	AraC has previously been shown to repress its own transcription by binding to a region overlapping the araC promoter elements ( 32 ) .	RI
24272778	343	The location of the AraC binding site upstream of ytfQ is too far upstream of the transcription start site to repress transcription by directly occluding RNAP .	RI
24272778	345	GalR has been shown to regulate ytfQ ( 44 ) ( Fig . S1 in the supplemental material ) .	RI
24272778	349	Although arabinose - dependent repression by AraC has not been observed before , there are clear parallels with arabinose - dependent activation of araBAD transcription .	RI
24272778	351	At the araC - araBAD intergenic region , AraC forms a repression loop in the absence of arabinose due to the dimerization of distally bound AraC monomers .	RI
24272778	360	ygeA and polB are positively regulated by AraC and arabinose due to partial read - through of Rho - independent terminators ( Fig . 2 , 4 , and 5 ) .	RI
24272778	375	Only one other novel AraC - regulated gene identified in this work , E . coli ytfQ , has a known connection to arabinose metabolism ( 39 ) .	RI
24272778	394	Hence , polB regulation by AraC may be widely conserved .	RI
21890697	8	ArgP mediates lysine ( Lys ) repression of argO , dapB , and gdhA in vivo , for which two alternative mechanisms have been identified : at the dapB and gdhA regulatory regions , ArgP binding is reduced upon the addition of Lys , whereas at argO , RNA polymerase is trapped at the step of promoter clearance by Lys - bound ArgP .	RI
21890697	9	In this study , we have examined promoter - lac fusions in strains that were argP or argP or that were carrying dominant argP mutations in order to identify several new genes that are ArgP - regulated in vivo , including lysP , lysC , lysA , dapD , and asd ( in addition to argO , dapB , and gdhA ) .	RI
21890697	10	All were repressed upon Lys supplementation , and in vitro studies demonstrated that ArgP binds to the corresponding regulatory regions in a Lys - sensitive manner ( with the exception of argO , whose binding to ArgP was Lys insensitive ) .	RI
21890697	16	( That E . coli gdhA may be under ArgP control had also been suggested earlier [ 33 ] . ) In addition , in vitro studies have suggested that ArgP activates the transcription of the dnaA and nrdA genes that are involved in DNA metabolism and replication ( 20 , 27 – 29 ) .	RI
21890697	30	Stable recruitment by ArgP of RNA polymerase to the argO promoter is observed in the presence of Arg or Lys , following which the two coeffectors exert dramatically opposite effects in the ternary complex ; whereas productive transcription from the argO promoter is stimulated in the presence of ArgP and Arg , RNA polymerase is trapped at the promoter at a step after open complex formation in the presence of ArgP and Lys ( 26 ) .	RI
21890697	41	Our results indicate that negative regulation involving Lys as coeffector is mediated by ArgP and that the target genes include argO , lysP , lysC , asd , dapB , dapD , lysA , and gdhA .	RI
21890697	74	At the time that these experiments were done , the genes known to be ArgP regulated in vivo included the following ( gene functions are indicated in parentheses ) : argO ( Arg export ) , dapB ( dihydrodipicolinate reductase in the diaminopimelate - Lys biosynthetic pathway ) , and K . pneumoniae gdhA ( glutamate dehydrogenase for NH 4 assimilation and glutamate biosynthesis ) .	RI
21890697	116	Under identical experimental conditions as for argO , the regulatory regions of the other ArgP - regulated genes ( asd , dapB , dapD , gdhA , lysA , lysC , and lysP ) were also bound by ArgP , with apparent K d s ranging from 55 nM to 170 nM ; in all these cases ( unlike the situation with argO ) , the addition of Lys was associated with an increase in the apparent K d , indicating that ArgP binding in these instances is Lys sensitive .	RI
21890697	122	The results described above indicated that ArgP binds the lysP regulatory region to mediate its nearly 35 - fold transcriptional activation and that the absence of such ArgP binding either in argP mutants or upon Lys supplementation in argP strains results in very low levels of lysP expression .	RI
21890697	124	Recently , Ruiz et al . ( 41 ) had also independently identified ArgP ’ s role both as a transcriptional activator and in mediating the repression of the lysP gene by Lys .	RI
21890697	125	However , they reported that ArgP binds the lysP regulatory region with similar affinities in both the absence and presence of Lys and had accordingly suggested that ArgP mediates Lys repression of lysP by the same mechanism of RNA polymerase trapping that it does at argO .	RI
21890697	126	Since our results were different from those of Ruiz et al . ( 41 ) , we repeated the EMSA experiments with lysP , using a graded series of ArgP concentrations in the absence or presence of Lys ( Fig . 2A ) ; the data clearly establish that binding of ArgP to the lysP template is Lys sensitive .	RI
21890697	130	ArgP and cadBA regulation .	RI
21890697	134	Since our findings indicated that ArgP is needed for activation of lysP transcription , we tested whether cadBA expression would be rendered Lys independent even in the argP mutant .	RI
21890697	145	Since ArgP is required for transcription of the Arg exporter ArgO , we also tested the promoters of other genes known to be involved in Arg transport ( artP , artJ , argT , and the hisJQMP operon ) as candidates for regulation by ArgP .	RI
21890697	158	In its description as IciA , ArgP has been reported to regulate dnaA and nrdA transcription ( 20 , 27 – 29 ) .	RI
21890697	160	Our conclusion runs contrary to that of Han et al . ( 20 ) , who overproduced IciA ( ArgP ) and employed an RNase protection assay to show that nrdA transcription is ArgP regulated in vivo .	RI
21890697	161	In EMSA experiments using ArgP and the cis regulatory regions of both dnaA and nrdA , we observed binding at an apparent K d of around 150 nM that was unchanged in the presence or absence of Lys ( Fig . 3 and Table 4 ) .	RI
21890697	168	In the case of argO , ArgP mediates its transcriptional activation by Arg , as well as its repression by Lys ( 7 , 26 , 32 , 37 ) ; the latter is achieved by a mechanism involving the active trapping at the argO promoter by ArgP of RNA polymerase , which is then prevented from being released to engage in productive transcription ( 26 ) .	RI
21890697	171	These include lysP , lysC , lysA , dapD , and asd ( in addition to argO , dapB , and gdhA ) , all of which exhibited ArgP - mediated repression upon Lys supplementation in vivo , as well as ArgP binding to the corresponding cis regulatory regions in vitro .	RI
21890697	198	LysR also mediates Lys repression ( of lysA ) , but in this case it has been suggested that the coeffector ligand is diaminopimelic acid ( which is the substrate for lysA ) and that the latter ’ s binding to LysR converts it into its activator conformation ( 30 , 36 ) .	RI
21890697	204	In vitro , ArgP binds the lysP regulatory region with a K d of around 55 nM and the binding affinity is diminished upon the addition of Lys ( to a K d of 140 nM ) , suggesting that Lys represses lysP in vivo by engendering the loss of ArgP binding to the lysP operator region .	RI
21890697	211	While this work was being completed , Ruiz et al . ( 41 ) independently reported the identification of lysP as a Lys - repressed transcriptional target of ArgP .	RI
21890697	228	At the same time , it is noteworthy that two of the genes that are most prominently regulated by ArgP , argO and lysP , are both also regulated by the leucineresponsive general transcriptional regulator Lrp ( 37 , 41 ) .	RI
21890697	317	Lysine represses transcription of the Escherichia coli dapB gene by preventing its activation by the ArgP activator .	RI
9537375	6	In a gntR deletion mutant , the expression of a chromosomal gntT : : lacZ fusion is both high and constitutive , confirming that GntR is the negative regulator of gntT .	RI
9537375	12	Transcription of gntT is activated by binding of the cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) - cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) complex to a CRP binding site positioned at 71 upstream of the gntT transcription start site .	RI
9537375	35	In this study , we show for the first time that the operator sequence is indeed the binding site for the negative regulator GntR and that gluconate is the true inducer of gntT , by inactivation of GntR binding to the operator .	RI
9537375	36	The results in this report also demonstrate that gntT is regulated by the cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) - cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) complex , which was found be essential for full induction .	RI
9537375	104	To investigate the role of GntR in repression of the gntT gene , the expression of a single - copy chromosomal gntT : : lacZ fusion was measured in a gntR mutant .	RI
9537375	121	To investigate the role of the CRP and adenylate cyclase in catabolite repression of the gntT gene by glucose and gluconate , crp and cya null mutations were transduced into the strain carrying the chromosomal gntT : : lacZ fusion .	RI
9537375	125	In summary , these results demonstrate that gntT is positively regulated by CRP .	RI
9537375	153	In summary , the results clearly demonstrate that both operators are required for repression of gntT by GntR .	RI
9537375	179	During the course of this work , it became apparent that GntR might affect gntT expression by a mechanism that is independent of negative control by operator binding as well as activation by cAMP - CRP .	RI
9537375	274	However , it is possible that the closely related YjgS protein , which is 46 % identical to GntR , is involved in the positive regulation of gntT .	RI
9537375	282	These results confirm that regulation of the gntT gene by GntR is similar to other negatively regulated systems .	RI
9537375	296	We favor the idea that the repression of gntT is the result of DNA looping through interaction between the two GntR molecules as shown for many other operons in E . coli , such as the ara , gal , lac , and deo operons ( 29 ) .	RI
9537375	297	A greater extent of derepression results from mutation of the external operator site by comparison to the internal operator site mutants , suggesting that binding of GntR to the external site results in a stronger repression of the gntT gene .	RI
8655507	225	An excellent CAP - binding site ( 19 ) is centered at bp 70 with respect to the transcriptional start site of the gntK gene , explaining the phenomenon of glucose catabolite repression observed in Northern blot analysis .	RI
8655507	227	It is interesting to speculate that this is the element responsible for binding GntR and repression of gntKU expression .	RI
12618441	6	GntR represses the GntI genes gntKU and gntT , whereas GntH was previously suggested to be an activator for the GntII genes gntV and idnDO - gntWH .	RI
12618441	14	These results led us to propose that GntH activates GntII and represses the GntI genes in the presence of metabolites derived from gluconate , allowing the organism to switch from the GntI to the GntII system .	RI
12618441	30	Both gntT and gntKU are regulated positively by the cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) - cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) complex and negatively by GntR ; one GntR - binding element for gntK has been proposed ( 12 , 34 ) , and two GntR - binding elements for gntT were experimentally defined ( 26 ) .	RI
12618441	48	In this study we have shown the negative regulation mechanism of the GntI system by GntR and also by GntH , an activator for the GntII system .	RI
12618441	114	COLI 1787 Downloaded from http : / / jb . asm . org / FIG . 2 — Continued . on January 11 , 2016 by Instituto de Biotecnologia , UNAM the gntK expression was repressed by GntR in the absence of gluconate .	RI
12618441	193	These observations led us to conclude that GntH might bind to GntR elements and might repress the GntI genes .	RI
12618441	229	Taken together , GntH seems to repress the expression of the gntKU and gntT genes , and the repression occurs even in the presence of gluconate , which could be physiologically important , as discussed below .	RI
12618441	264	These results suggest that in the presence of gluconate , the expression of the GntI genes was induced at early logarithmic phase and was then repressed by a GntH - dependent mechanism .	RI
12618441	279	These results suggest that both GntRbinding sequences , R1 and R2 , are responsible for the repression of gntKU expression , although the affinity of GntR or GntH for R1 seems to be different from that for R2 .	RI
12618441	304	These results appear to be consistent with those from the experiments with lacZ operon fusions , as shown in Table 4 , and it is likely that the binding of GntR to a single element ( the R1 sequence ) is capable of decreasing the transcription of the gntKU genes .	RI
12618441	311	Significant primary sequence homology between GntR and GntH , especially in their HTH motifs for DNA binding , led us to hypothesize that GntH , an activator for the GntII genes , represses the GntI genes via GntR - binding elements .	RI
12618441	314	In contrast to the case for GntR , the GntI genes in the presence of cloned GntH were negligibly induced by gluconate ( Table 3 ; Fig . 5 ) .	RI
12618441	324	Notably , GntH was able to repress the GntI genes even in the presence of gluconate .	RI
12618441	329	At the same time , GntH may induce the expression of the GntII genes ; this is supported by evidence showing that the GntII genes have an expression peak at the late logarithmic or stationary phase ( unpublished data ) .	RI
12618441	330	We postulate that GntH is responsible for repression of the GntI genes when GntR was released from the operator by interaction with gluconate , and for induction of the GntII genes .	RI
12618441	332	In the model , gluconate is first imported by gluconate permease , GntP , as demonstrated ( 15 ) , and interacts with the GntR molecule to induce the GntI system genes .	RI
12618441	344	The products 5 - ketogluconate and idonate bind to GntH , resulting in activation of the GntII genes and repression of the GntI genes .	RI
12618441	345	Finally , gluconate depletion inside the cell leads to the repression of the GntI genes by GntR again .	RI
12618441	348	The production of GntH may repress the GntI genes by forming a complex with 5 - ketogluconate or idonate and further induce GntII genes , whereas GntR molecules are being released from the operators in the state of interacting with gluconate .	RI
8636021	19	Thus , transcription of the marRAB operon is autorepressed by MarR and autoactivated by MarA at a site that also can be activated by SoxS .	RI
8636021	39	We report here the existence of a " mar / soxbox " upstream of the - 35 hexamer which binds MarA and enables activation of mar transcription by MarA and SoxS both in vitro and in vivo .	RI
8636021	40	Thus , the mar operon has the remarkable property that its first gene product , MarR , represses its transcription whereas the second gene product , MarA , stimulates its transcription .	RI
8636021	148	The results , summarized as follows , show that mar can be activated in vivo via either MarA or SoxS acting on the marbox promoter region .	RI
8636021	168	The ability of MarA to autoactivate the mar promoter was studied as a function of time following induction by salicylate .	RI
8636021	178	Thus , maximum activation of the mar regulon promoter inaA depends on the autostimulatory effect of MarA on the mar operon .	RI
8636021	188	We surmise , from the distance of this marbox ( centered at - 61.5 ) to the putative - 35 transcriptional signal ( 17 , 18 ) , that activation of mar by MarA requires interaction with the carboxy - terminal domain of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase , i . e . , that MarA is a class I activator ( 16 ) of mar as it is for zwf .	RI
7836283	19	Expression of the operon , consisting of marR , marA , and marB , is normally repressed by MarR but can be induced by diverse compounds such as tetracycline , chloramphenicol , menadione , and salicylates ( 6 , 16 , 28 ) .	RI
7836283	154	OmpR can activate or repress the ompF gene depending on osmolarity conditions and the strength of the promoter ( 30 ) .	RI
7836283	159	Such is the path by which OmpF expression is decreased by mar operon - directed increased expression of micF ( 8 ) .	RI
19376854	13	waaY expression was also regulated by MarA ( multiple - antibiotic resistance regulator ) , which shares a binding site ( soxbox ) with SoxS , and was induced by salicylate , a nonoxidative compound .	RI
19376854	22	MarA activates the expression of diverse genes , including acrAB , micF , mlr - 1 , - 2 , and - 3 , slp , and inaA , which endow cells with resistance ( 3 ) .	RI
19376854	185	In the previous regulatory model , the expression of waaP and waaY was regulated by RfaH ( SfrB ) , an antiterminator protein , and this regulation was achieved over the whole transcript from the top promoter in front of waaQ ( 29 ) .	RI
19376854	246	waaY promoter is also induced by antibiotics through the mar system .	RI
14701822	12	We found that purified MarA was sufficient in vitro to repress transcription of both purA and hdeA .	RI
14701822	25	To determine whether the repression by MarA was direct or occurred by an indirect action , we focused on two genes , purA and hdeA .	RI
14701822	26	In the intact cell , transcription of purA was decreased in cells constitutively producing MarA ( 4 ) .	RI
14701822	27	Expression of hdeA was repressed by induced expression of MarA ( see Ref . 5 , Supplemental Material ) .	RI
14701822	32	We show here that MarA directly represses both purA and hdeA .	RI
14701822	85	In the same experiment we also examined the expression of hdeA , which had been observed in another macroarray study to be repressed upon MarA induction in cells ( 5 ) .	RI
14701822	86	After a 1 - h induction of MarA by IPTG , a decline was seen in the levels of transcripts of purA ( Fig . 1A ) and hdeA ( Fig . 1B ) .	RI
14701822	90	These results show that the decrease in purA and hdeA expression was caused , directly or indirectly , by transiently synthesized MarA rather than by a stress reaction due to constitutively overabundant MarA .	RI
14701822	92	This protein , engineered to facilitate purification and hereafter referred to as MarA , had been shown previously to activate nfnB transcription in vitro ( 20 ) .	RI
14701822	96	The promoter for the MarA - activated gene nfnB ( 20 ) , also mixed with gnd DNA , was tested in parallel as a positive control for MarA activity .	RI
14701822	97	In the presence of 200 nM MarA , there was a 5 – 6 - fold activation in nfnB transcription , as expected ( Fig . 2 ) .	RI
14701822	99	The same concentration and batch of MarA protein , on the other hand , repressed both purA and hdeA ( Fig . 2 ) .	RI
14701822	100	The average repression ratio was 0.44 for purA ( see Fig . 5 , WT ) and 0.60 for hdeA ( see Fig . 6 , WT ) relative to controls without MarA .	RI
14701822	101	These results showed that MarA by itself could directly repress purA and hdeA transcription .	RI
14701822	136	These results together indicated that marbox 3 , and particularly its RE2 , was critical for repression of hdeA by MarA .	RI
14701822	163	The physiological significance of the repression of purA and hdeA by MarA is not known .	RI
14701822	165	The purA promoter is repressed by PurR in the presence of purines ( 32 ) , and the promoter of hdeA is repressed by HN - S ( 33 ) .	RI
14701822	168	The repression of purA by MarA was quantitatively similar in vivo and in vitro , whereas that of hdeA was greater in vivo ( ~ 6 – 25 - fold ) than in vitro ( ~ 1.7 - fold ) .	RI
12100559	12	Using in vitro assays and mutagenesis of promoter fusions in whole cells , we identified the cis regulatory element involved in MarA upregulation of the oxygeninsensitive nitroreductase nfnB gene .	RI
12100559	36	Liochev and colleagues ( Liochev et al . , 1999 ) have shown that the activity of NfsA was induced by exposure to paraquat in a SoxR - dependent fashion and therefore nfsA was also a member of the soxRS regulon .	RI
12100559	42	We show here that MarA directly mediates upregulation of nfnB expression through a cis - recognition marbox element in the nfnB promoter .	RI
12100559	45	Transcription of nfnB is greatly increased by induced or constitutive chromosomal expression of MarA but is unaltered by constitutive expression of chromosomal SoxS and Rob .	RI
12100559	49	MarA upregulates expression of nfnB Both oxygen - insensitive nitroreductases nfsA and nfnB were shown to be upregulated by constitutive expression of MarA from plasmid pAS10 ( Barbosa and Levy , 2000 ) .	RI
12100559	53	To confirm that the nfnB activation observed in the array study was specifically mediated by MarA rather than by a cell stress response to the constitutive expression of the protein from a multicopy number plasmid , Northern blot analysis was performed on cells in which MarA production was inducible .	RI
12100559	64	The strong upregulation of nfnB by the plasmidspecified MarA observed in this study contrasts with the reported weaker upregulation of NfnB activity and nfnB expression by SoxS ( Liochev et al . , 1999 ; Pomposiello et al . , 2001 ) .	RI
12100559	70	These results show that constitutive and inducible expression of the chromosomal MarA was able to upregulate nfnB expression in contrast with the lack of activation mediated by constitutive expression of the chromosomal SoxS and Rob proteins .	RI
12100559	74	Although marbox 1 and marbox 4 were closely related to the degenerate consensus sequence ( 3 nt differences out of 14 specified nt ) ( Fig . 3B ) , their location , downstream from the - 10 hexamer and 83 nt upstream from the - 35 hexamer , respectively , suggested that these marboxes were probably not functional in the MarA activation of nfnB .	RI
12100559	78	When reactions were carried out in the presence of RNAP alone as compared with 200 nM purified His 6 - MarA , we detected MarA upregulation of nfnB transcription ( Fig . 4 ) .	RI
12100559	136	An important observation was that purified MarA was able to activate transcription in vitro of nfnB .	RI
12100559	140	Additionally , although induction of chromosomal marA in wild - type cells by sodium salicylate caused a clear upregulation of nfnB expression , identical concentrations of 2,2 ´ - dipyridyl ( 5 mM ) , recently reported as an inducer of the chromosomal Rob ( Rosner et al . , 2002 ) , failed to demonstrate such an effect .	RI
12100559	143	For instance , Rob has been shown to bind and activate the zwf promoter in vitro but whole cell zwf regulation cannot be activated by Rob , although the gene responds to SoxS and MarA ( Ariza et al . , 1995 ; Jair et al . , 1995 1996a ; b ) .	RI
12100559	150	However , this idea was contradicted when a single mutation at position 16 ( C to G ) of RE 2 , which has been shown to establish direct contacts with the second of two HTH motifs of MarA ( Rhee et al . , 1998 ; Dangi et al . , 2001 ) , eliminated MarA - mediated activation of the nfnB gene .	RI
12067348	21	marA expression is repressed by MarR and is derepressed by the interaction of MarR with various phenolic compounds such as salicylate .	RI
12067348	22	soxS expression is activated by an oxidized form of SoxR produced by treating cells with the superoxide - generating agent paraquat ( Demple , 1996 ) .	RI
12067348	25	The three activators may have different quantitative effects on particular promoters , for example SoxS activates fpr to a much greater extent than does MarA .	RI
12067348	69	mdaA ( also known as nfsA ) but not ybjC had previously been shown to be regulated by SoxS although no binding site had been identified ( Liochev et al . , 1999 ) .	RI
12067348	87	Although not tested directly , the ybjC - mdaA operon may contain a third gene , rimK , as : ( i ) there does not appear to be either an RNA chain termination signal nor a promoter between mdaA and rimK ( they are separated by 172 bp ) ; ( ii ) Barbosa and Levy ( Barbosa and Levy 2000 ) observed the induction of rimK in their microarray analysis for MarA - induced genes ; and ( iii ) the nearest potential MarA binding site upstream of rimK is that identified for ybjC .	RI
12067348	90	They demonstrated that acnA has two promoters , P1 and P2 , the latter being regulated by SoxS , FNR , CRP and ArcA .	RI

12067348	128	Thus , stimulation of b1452 was dependent on MarA and a region ( – 131 to – 111 ) identified as a potential binding site for the activators . map and mdaB .	RI

11601842	153	SoxR is a sensor protein activated by oxidative stress and in turn it transcriptionally activates soxS .	RI
11601842	161	A common phenotype associated with transcriptional activation of micF by Rob , SoxS and MarA is multiple antibiotic resistance .	RI
11601842	182	Other unknowns are how OmpR activates micF transcription while binding at far upstream sequences , i . e . in the - 156 to - 216 region ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) .	RI
11601842	185	However , in vitro experiments show IHF to repress ompC transcription from two of its three promoters .	RI

2543976	55	Similar to the results of metE expression , MetR greatly stimulates the synthesis of MetH using plasmid pQN1011 as template ( lane 5 vs . lane 7 ) .	RI
2543976	58	It should be noted ( lanes 1 - 4 ) that although plasmid pRSE562 directs the synthesis of the MetR protein there is still a large stimulation of metE expression by added MetR protein .	RI
2543976	65	Although MetJ and AdoMet have little effect on the synthesis of MetH ( line 1 vs . line 3 ) , they inhibit the expression of the metE gene by 75 % ( line 1 vs . line 3 ) .	RI
2543976	66	The addition of MetJ and AdoMet to incubations containing MetR also results in a 75 % inhibition of metE expression but no effect on MetH expression ( line 2 vs . line 4 ) .	RI
2543976	73	If the MetR protein synthesized from pRSE562 was responsible for the observed increase in MetH synthesis , the MetJ protein and AdoMet , if added to the first incubation , should inhibit the increase by preventing MetR synthesis .	RI
2543976	128	The results of the present study extend these observations and show that the MetR protein also stimulates the in vitro expression of metH and that both the MetE and MetH proteins synthesized in vitro are enzymatically active .	RI
2543976	142	One explanation for this discrepancy is that the purified MetR protein ( 20 ) may be partly inactive so that the amount needed for activation of metE and metH expression in vitro appears higher than actually required .	RI
2543976	146	It should be mentioned that Plamann and Stauffer ( 35 ) noted that a deletion in this area resulted in a loss of MetR activation of the in vivo synthesis of a metE - lac fusion protein .	RI
2543976	147	The finding of only one MetR binding site suggests that the binding of MetR to this region may be responsible for both the activation of expression of metE as well as the autoregulation of metR ( 20 , 36 ) .	RI
2543976	161	Thus , binding of MetJ to this area could serve to simultaneously repress both metR and metE expression .	RI
2543976	163	These latter results , together with the experiments described here showing that MetJ binds to this region of DNA , strongly suggest that the - 8 to + 27 region is involved in metE repression .	RI
11139621	3	NagC represses nagE , encoding the N - acetylglucosamine - specific transporter , while Mlc represses three PTS operons , ptsG , manXYZ and ptsHIcrr , involved in the uptake of glucose .	RI
11139621	27	Recent experiments on the mlc - regulated genes showed that although NagC binding to Mlc operators could be detected in vitro , there was no or little regulation in vivo ( 6,17 , unpublished results ) .	RI
11139621	176	Binding of NagC and Mlc to nagE operators in vivo As Mlc showed a stronger affinity for the nagE operator than NagC , it seemed possible that Mlc might be able to regulate the nagE promoter in the absence of NagC in vivo . ThreenagE – lacZ fusions were tested : the standard ‘ loop - forming ’ nagBE – lacZ fusion , whose expression is repressed by NagC binding co - operatively to the nagE and nagB operators ; and two single operator nagE – lacZ fusions , missing the nagB promoter / operator , but carrying the same nagE – lacZ junction .	RI
11139621	188	To verify that Mlc does bind preferentially to the nagE operator in vivo , the effect of plasmids overproducing either Mlc or NagC was tested in a strain mutated for both mlc and nagC . Plasmids expressing either NagC or Mlc produce considerable repression of the nagBE – lacZ looped fusion , reducing expression 88 - and 56 - fold ( Table 2 ) .	RI
11139621	190	The preferential repression by NagC at the looped nagBE – lacZ fusion , compared with the nagE – lacZ fusion with a single operator site , emphasises that regulation by NagC is normally dependent upon DNA loop formation involving the higher - affinity nagB operator .	RI
11139621	197	The expression of ptsG is controlled by Mlc binding to two operators upstream of two promoters , both of which are subject to Mlc repression .	RI
11139621	274	It should be remembered that nagE encodes the GlcNAc - specific PTS transporter and the genes for two other PTS transporters ( ptsG and manXYZ ) plus the genes for the central components of the PTS ( ptsHIcrr ) have been shown to be regulated by Mlc ( 6 – 11 ) .	RI
11139621	277	However the much stronger repression of this fusion by overproduced Mlc , compared with overproduced NagC , shows that the isolated nagE operator site has a higher affinity for Mlc than NagC .	RI
11139621	283	The glmUS operon , which is regulated positively by NagC , also relies upon co - operative binding of NagC to two sites ( 2 ) .	RI

7601827	117	RESULTS Maximal nitrate repression of pfl expression is dependent on functional NarL , NarP , NarX , and NarQ proteins .	RI
7601827	217	For example , nitrate induction of the narGHJI operon ( 21 ) and the narK gene ( 12 ) is controlled exclusively by NarL , while induction of the fdnGHI operon is controlled principally by NarL , but NarP also effects a degree of control ( observed with a narL mutant ) ( 21 ) .	RI
7601827	218	Expression of the dmsABC and the frdABCD operons is repressed in the presence of nitrate , and this repression is dependent on the NarL protein ( 8 , 10 , 21 , 28 ) .	RI
7601827	267	The mechanism which the cell employs to repress pfl expression with nitrate clearly involves NarL and NarP , but a further factor ( s ) which dictates whether repression is strong or weak , perhaps in response to the intracellular redox status , must be involved .	RI

7854119	8	Summary Expression from both the Escherichia coli nir and nrf promoters is dependent on anaerobic induction by FNR but is further reguiated by NarL and NarP in response to the presence of nitrite and nitrate in the growth medium .	RI
7854119	11	The nrf promoter can be activated by either NarP or NarL in response to nitrite but is repressed by NarL in response to nitrate .	RI
7854119	23	For example , the expression of nitrate reductase is stimulated by NarL whilst fumarate reductase is repressed , thus ensuring that nitrate is used as an electron acceptor in preference to fumarate .	RI
7854119	185	The resuits in Tabie 7 confirm that expression from pnrf was totally FNR dependent and induced during anaerobic growth .	RI
8437517	14	Mutations in the putative NarL - binding site at the nirB promoter decrease FNR - dependent anaerobic induction , suggesting that NarL acts as a helper to FNR during transcription activation .	RI
8437517	23	NarL , wiiicin was initiaily discovered as a transcription factor essentiai for the activation of nitrate reductase expression by nitrate ( Stewart , 1982 ) , Recent studies of the nitrate reductase promoter have identified the FNR - and NarLbinding sites around 41 and 200 bp upstream of the transcription start , respectiveiy ( Li and DeMoss , 1988 ; Walker andDeMoss , 1991 ; Dong ef a / . , 1992 ) .	RI
8437517	25	For exampie , whiist NarL is responsibie for maximum induction of nitrate reductase during anaerobic growth in the presence of nitrate , FNR - dependent expression of fumarate reductase is repressed by NarL , Thus , NarL ensures that nitrate , rather than energeticaily less rewarding substrates , is used as a terminal electron acceptor ( reviewed by iuchiandLin , 1991 ) .	RI
10537212	12	This latter result indicated that ArcA suppresses anaerobic hyb expression and that a further factor , which remains to be identified , is involved in controlling anaerobic induction of operon expression .	RI
10537212	116	In the narL narP double null mutant , nitrate repression of hyb expression was relieved and anaerobic regulation after growth in the absence of nitrate was similar to that observed in the wild - type strain ( Table 3 ) .	RI
10537212	120	This suggested that the hyb operon is subject to catabolite repression mediated by the cAMP - CRP system ( Busby &amp; Kolb , 1996 ) .	RI

11004182	11	While either NarL or NarP was able to induce nrfA - lacZ expression in response to low levels of nitrate , only NarL could repress at high nitrate levels .	RI
11004182	27	Expression of the nrfABCDEFG operon ( previously described as aeg - 93 [ 3 ] ) and the nirBDC operon is elevated during anaerobic cell growth by the Fnr regulatory protein ( 1 , 10 , 14 ) .	RI
11004182	28	The addition of nitrite , but not nitrate , is reported to further elevate nrfA expression via either the NarL or NarP response regulators .	RI
11004182	29	In contrast , NarL is reported to repress nrfA expression in response to nitrate , whereas NarP cannot ( 14 – 16 , 23 , 24 ) .	RI
11004182	31	In contrast , only NarL is reported to activate nirB in response to nitrite ( 23 , 24 ) .	RI
11004182	105	From prior batch culture experiments , both NarL and NarP were reported to activate nirB - lacZ in response to nitrate ( 23 , 24 ) .	RI
11004182	106	The chemostat experiments ( Fig . 3A ) also demonstrate that NarL or NarP can function independently of each other to induce nirB expression in response to nitrate .	RI
11004182	130	During batch cell culture conditions , nitrite was reported to induce nrfA expression via either the NarL or NarP response regulator proteins , while only nitrate was reported to cause repression of nrfA expression and only by NarL ( 14 , 16 , 24 ) .	RI
11004182	139	First , either NarL or NarP can activate nrfA - lacZ expression in response to added nitrate .	RI
11004182	140	Second , NarL can repress nrfA - lacZ expression when nitrate is present , whereas NarP cannot ( compare the NarL NarP strain to the NarL NarP strain and to the wild - type strain ) .	RI
11004182	143	These findings therefore require a reexamination of the regulatory models based on batch culture studies wherein NarL or NarP can activate nrfA expression in response to nitrite only ( 24 ) .	RI
11004182	153	Finally , either NarL or NarP was able to activate nrfA - lacZ expression independently of the other , while only NarL could repress expression .	RI
11004182	182	This indicates that ( i ) the 70 NarL heptamer site is essential for NarL to function as an activator of nrfA expression and that ( ii ) other sites are used for NarL to repress expression independently of the 70 site , in contrast to prior interpretations ( see Discussion ) .	RI
11004182	184	While NarL was still able to activate and to repress nrfA gene expression , the pattern differed from the wild - type nrfA - lacZ reporter fusion ( Fig . 6B ) .	RI
11004182	193	Therefore , the 22 heptamer site is a critical site for mediating NarL repression of nrfA gene expression .	RI
11004182	237	One of the more striking points in each model is that the NarP protein is nonessential ( i . e . , not a major player ) and that it can function as an antagonist of NarL in its ability to activate nirB or nrfA operon expression .	RI
11004182	254	NarX and / or NarQ sensors , both NarL and NarP are phosphorylated where either response regulator can then activate nrfA gene expression .	RI

11004182	308	During anaerobiosis , the Fnr protein ( F ) binds at its consensus recognition site , centered at 42 , to activate nirB operon expression .	RI
12079504	4	Expression of the dmsABC genes that encode the membrane - associated DMSO / TMAO reductase is positively regulated during anaerobic conditions by the Fnr protein and negatively regulated by the NarL protein when nitrate is present .	RI
12079504	6	Mutations within the Fnr site that deviated from the wild type sequence , TTGATaccgAACAA , or that removed an entire half - site , either impaired or abolished the anaerobic activation of dmsA - lacZ expression .	RI
12079504	24	Mutagenesis of the Fnr recognition sequence at the dmsA promoter region confirmed the contribution of Fnr in the 100 - fold activation of dmsABC expression and explored the DNA sequence and spacing requirements for the Fnr recognition site at the P1 promoter .	RI
12079504	26	These studies define the molecular interactions of Fnr and NarL at the dmsABC P1 promoter that together provide for the oxygen and nitrate regulated expression of this respiratory pathway operon .	RI
12079504	27	Results and Discussion Effect of cis - acting mutations in the Fnr binding site on anaerobic induction of dmsA - lacZ expression To investigate the effects of sequence changes in the dmsA Fnr - recognition site on the anaerobic activation of dmsAlacZ expression , site - directed mutagenesis and β - galactosidase assays were performed ( Figure 1 ) .	RI
12079504	29	A 3 - fold increase in anaerobic activation of dmsA - lacZ expression was observed for the consensus Fnr site ( 300 - fold ) relative to the 114 - fold anaerobic activation by Fnr seen for the native dmsA sequence ( Figure 1 , λJA303 and λJA250 , respectively ) .	RI
12079504	31	To our knowledge , this " consensus " Fnr - dependent dmsA promoter exhibits the highest anaerobic induction of any Fnr - regulated E . coli promoter examined .	RI
12079504	32	The enhanced ability of Fnr to activate dmsABC gene expression is possibly , by analogy to Crp , due to increased affinity of Fnr at the consensus versus the native non - consensus Fnr recognition sequence at dmsA .	RI
12079504	33	Likewise , the poor match of the Fnr site at the promoter for the fumarate reductase gene , frdA to the consensus Fnr sequence may account for the relatively weak anaerobic induction for this respiratory operon [ 14 ] .	RI
12079504	35	A single base substitution in the left half - site when combined with the Fnr consensus sequence at the right half - site exhibited a 138 - fold activation of dmsA - lacZ expression ( Figure 1 , λJA450 ) , an induction equivalent to the wild - type dmsA promoter that has the symmetrical deviation in the right half - site ( ca . 114 - fold ) .	RI
12079504	36	Thus , the left and right half - sites are equivalent in their ability to confer Fnr - dependent activation of dmsA gene expression by RNA polymerase .	RI
12079504	37	This is in contrast to the requirement for the left half - site of the Fnr1 regulatory site needed for Fnr - dependent repression at the cydA P1 promoter [ 15 ] .	RI
12079504	38	When a two base - pair change was introduced into the left Fnr halfsite ( e . g . , TTGAT to TTAGT ) of the native dmsA sequence , it nearly abolished the anaerobic induction of dmsA - lacZ expression ( Figure 1 , λJA257 ) .	RI
12079504	41	To evaluate how the spacing between the Fnr binding site and the start of dmsA transcription alters the anaerobic activation of dmsA - lacZ expression , single basepair insertions were introduced at position - 35 ( λJA448 and λJA449 ) .	RI
12079504	42	The 114 - fold anaerobic activation seen for the wild - type dmsA promoter was reduced to about 35 - fold in each of the two mutants ( Figure 1 ) , indicating that the position of the Fnr site at the wild - type dmsA promoter is important for controlling optimal dmsA gene expression .	RI
12079504	43	Thus , the dmsA promoter exhibits a preference for - 41.5 target sites like other Fnr - regulated class II promoters [ 16 ] .	RI
12079504	52	The effect of cis mutations on Fnr - dependent activation of dmsA - lacZ expression is shown in the lower right portion of the figure . β - galactosidase activity was measured from the cells containing the indicated fusion inserted in single copy at the att site .	RI
12079504	59	Location of NarL binding sites at the dmsA promoter Under anaerobic conditions , dmsA expression is repressed approximately 10 - fold by NarL when nitrate is present [ 4 ] .	RI
12079504	102	In addition , β - galactosidase assays revealed that the 10 - fold nitrate dependent repression of dmsA - lacZ expression was unaffected by the deletion of upstream DNA sequence to - 71 relative to the start of dmsA transcription , further pinpointing the location of the 5 ' end of the NarL recognition site for dmsA ( data not shown ) .	RI
12079504	106	Finally , a similar hydroxyl radical footprint pattern of 8 – 9 protected regions of 3 – 4 bp spaced 10 nucleotides apart was also observed for NarLphosphate at the promoter region of the frdA gene , another anaerobically induced gene that is repressed by NarL in the presence of nitrate ( data not shown ) .

RI
12079504	138	The data illustrates that Fnr is responsible for the 100 - fold anaerobic activation of dmsA expression .	RI
12079504	139	Also , both half - sites of the Fnr recognition sequence at dmsA are required for Fnrdependent expression and are similar in their ability to activate dmsA transcription .	RI

13129959	9	The napF operon control region exhibits unusual organization of DNA binding sites for the transcription regulators Fnr and NarP , which activate transcription in response to anaerobiosis and nitrate , respectively .	RI
13129959	14	These results establish the unconventional napF operon control region architecture , in which the major promoter P1 is activated by the Fnr protein bound to a site centered at 64.5 with respect to the transcription initiation site , working in conjunction with the phospho - NarP protein bound to a site centered at 44.5 .	RI
13129959	184	In the 146 strain , which retains the ModE protein binding site , ( napF - lacZ ) expression was induced during growth with added molybdate , and this induction required the modE allele ( data not shown ) .	RI
13129959	200	DISCUSSION The napF operon exhibits a unique pattern of expression and a unique control region architecture in comparison to other characterized E . coli Fnr - and Nar - regulated operons .	RI
13129959	211	One obvious difference between the synthetic promoter and the napF operon promoter is that transcription from the latter is also activated by the NarP protein bound to a site centered at position 44.5 .	RI
13129959	230	Likewise , the phospho - NarP protein , but not the phospho - NarL protein , in conjunction with the Fnr protein , activates in vitro transcription from the napF P1 promoter ( 10 ) .	RI
15667305	11	Nitrate - and nitriteinduced transcription from the hcp promoter was activated by the response regulator proteins NarL and NarP .	RI
15667305	44	Nitrate - and nitrite - mediated expression of the hcp is dependent on NarL and NarP Sequence analysis of the hcp regulatory region suggested that it contains a binding site for FNR and also binding sites for nitrite - and nitrate - activated regulators , NarL and NarP ( Figure 1 ) .	RI
15667305	52	This demonstrated that either NarL or NarP is required to activate transcription from the hcp promoter .	RI
15667305	53	Concluding remarks The hcp gene has been shown to be regulated by FNR , NarL and NarP proteins .	RI
15978080	11	Summary Expression from the Escherichia coli nrf operon promoter is activated by the anaerobically triggered transcription factor , FNR , and by the nitrate / nitrite ioncontrolled response regulators , NarL or NarP , but is repressed by the IHF and Fis proteins .	RI
15978080	18	Hence , Fis protein is a major factor responsible for catabolite repression at the nrf promoter , and Fis can override activation by FNR and NarL or NarP .	RI
15978080	32	We previously found that two other DNA - binding proteins , Fis ( factor for inversion stimulation ) and IHF ( integration host factor ) , bind to the nrf promoter and downregulate its activity ( Browning et al . , 2002 ) .	RI
15978080	46	Our results show that Fis plays a key role in catabolite repression at the nrf promoter and that its binding overrides the actions of the other regulators .	RI
15978080	67	As the DNA binding site for FNR overlaps the acsP1 - 35 element , it is easy to understand how FNR represses acsP1 at the same time as it activates the nrf promoter .	RI
15978080	68	Other results in Fig . 2A show that FNR - dependent activation of the nrf promoter is repressed by Fis or IHF proteins .	RI
15978080	76	Results in Fig . 2B ( lanes 4 – 6 , 10 – 12 ) show that NarL can enhance FNR - dependent activation of the nrf promoter .	RI
15978080	167	Fis and FNR moderate catabolite repression at the nrf promoter The locations of the different mutations that relieve catabolite repression at the nrf promoter suggest the involvement of Fis , FNR and , possibly , IHF ( Fig . 6 ) .	RI
15978080	205	To investigate further the involvement of Fis in catabolite repression , the expression of an nrf : : lac fusion was compared in cells with and without a functional fis gene .	RI
15978080	260	We suspect that this may account for the downregulation of FNR - dependent activation of the nrf promoter by IHF , but this is unproven .	RI
15978080	290	As at the nrf promoter , the nir promoter can be activated by FNR alone but FNRdependent activation is repressed by IHF and Fis ( Wu et al . , 1998 ; Browning et al . , 2000 ) .	RI
15978080	294	The binding of NarL or NarP to the nir promoter displaces IHF and overrides the repression of FNR - dependent activation by IHF and Fis ( Browning et al . , 2004 ) .	RI
15978080	311	Binding of Fis and IHF to sites centred at positions - 15 and - 54 , respectively , represses FNR - dependent transcription at the nrf promoter .	RI
15978080	317	Binding of Cra protein to a site centred at position - 16.5 represses the nir promoter when cells are in minimal medium ( Tyson et al . , 1997 ) .	RI
7643383	8	Expression of the aeg - 46.5 operon NY 14853 - 8101 , USA ( anaerobically expressed gene at 46.5 minutes on the genetic map ) is induced during anaerobic growth by the global transcriptional regulatory protein Fnr .	RI
7643383	9	aeg - 46.5 operon expression is further induced by the NarP protein in response to nitrate or nitrite and this induction is antagonized by NarL .	RI
7643383	12	A sequence with similarity to the Fnr - binding site consensus , centered at position 64.5 , was essential for Fnr - dependent anaerobic induction of aeg - 46.5 operon expression .	RI
7643383	20	Apparently , only the NarP protein is competent to activate transcription of the aeg - 46.5 operon when bound to the 44.5 region .	RI
7643383	31	Some of these operons are regulated by the NarL protein alone , such as the narG and frdA operons , whereas expression of the nirB ( encoding NADH - dependent nitrite reductase ) , nrfA and fdnG operons is controlled by both the NarL and NarP proteins .	RI
7643383	34	These binding sites are located upstream of the Fnr - binding site in the control regions of the NarL - activated narG , fdnG and narK operons .	RI
7643383	36	Nitrate and nitrite induction of the nirB operon and nitrite induction of nrfA operon expression is mediated to differing extents by the NarL and NarP proteins ( Rabin &amp; Stewart , 1993 ; Tyson et al . , 1993 , 1994 ) .	RI
7643383	37	Mutational analysis of the nirB and nrfA operon control regions has identified cis - acting regions that are required for both NarL and NarP - dependent induction ( Tyson et al . , 1994 ) .	RI
7643383	43	Previous experiments suggest that the nitrate and nitrite induction of aeg - 46.5 operon expression is mediated solely by the NarP protein , in contrast to all other nitrate and / or nitrite - inducible operons studied to date that are efficiently activated by the NarL protein alone or by both the NarL and NarP proteins ( Rabin &amp; Stewart , 1993 ) .	RI
7643383	44	The NarP - dependent nitrate and nitrite induction of aeg - 46.5 operon expression is increased in a narL null strain .	RI
7643383	74	These observations indicate that the region that is essential for normal Fnr - dependent induction of aeg - 46.5 operon expression is located downstream of position 85 .	RI
7643383	83	Also , the effects of control region deletions from 275 to 68 on the nitrate and nitrite induction ratios of aeg - 46.5 operon expression ( Table 1 ) may be an indirect result of the effect on Fnr - dependent regulation .	RI
7643383	95	Thus , it appears that the NarL protein can weakly induce aeg - 46.5 operon expression in response to nitrate .	RI
7643383	106	These observations confirm the importance of the 64.5 sequence in the Fnr - dependent induction of aeg - 46.5 operon expression .	RI
7643383	136	The results suggest that the NarP protein specifically interacts with the 44.5 region in order to activate aeg - 46.5 operon expression .	RI
7643383	187	These results confirm that occupancy of heptamers 40 and 49 by the NarP protein is essential for efficient nitrate and nitrite induction of aeg - 46.5 operon expression .	RI
7643383	225	This unusual spacing in relation to the RNA polymerase binding site may reflect a distinct mechanism by which Fnr ( and NarP ) activates aeg - 46.5 operon expression .	RI
7643383	227	A NarP / NarL site centered at – 44.5 bp Our results demonstrate that the symmetrical region centered at position 44.5 ( Choe &amp; Reznikoff , 1993 ) is essential for NarP - dependent nitrate and nitrite activation of aeg - 46.5 operon expression .	RI
7643383	243	However , narG and frdA operon expression is regulated by the NarL protein alone ( Rabin &amp; Stewart , 1993 ) , suggesting that the NarL binding sites in these control regions are not efficiently recognized by the NarP protein .	RI
7643383	247	The NarL and NarP proteins are each able to activate expression of the nirB and nrfA operons by interaction with common DNA - binding sites .	RI
7643383	249	The NarL / NarP protein binding sites required for activation of the nirB and nrfA operons are located further upstream ( 69.5 and 74.5 , respectively ) than that of the aeg - 46.5 operon ( 44.5 ) .	RI
7643383	258	Negative regulation of aeg - 46.5 operon expression by the NarL protein In addition to its function as a transcriptional activator , the NarL protein negatively regulates expression of the frdA , dmsA and nrfA operons in response to nitrate availability .	RI
7643383	261	aeg - 46.5 operon expression is also negatively regulated by the NarL protein but in this case NarL does not appear to act as a classical repressor .	RI
7643383	266	In an anaerobic environment the Fnr protein ( F ) is active and binds to the – 64.5 site to induce aeg - 46.5 operon expression .	RI
7643383	268	The NarL and NarP proteins compete for the 44.5 binding site ; binding of NarP further induces aeg - 46.5 operon expression , whereas binding of NarL has no significant effect on the basal anaerobic ( Fnr - dependent ) level of expression .	RI
7643383	280	Since only the NarP protein can activate aeg - 46.5 operon expression ( again , presumably by interacting with RNA polymerase ) , the competition from NarL for the binding sites would lead to an antagonization of NarP activation .	RI
7643383	284	Thus , antagonization of NarP - independent activation of aeg - 46.5 operon expression by the NarL protein should be more pronounced in the presence of nitrate than nitrate .	RI
7643383	477	Upstream sequence elements required for NarL - mediated activation of transcription from the narGHJI promoter of Escherichia coli .	RI
7643383	718	NarL - phosphate must bind to multiple upstream sites to activate transcription from the narG promoter of Escherichia coli .	RI
8501030	15	We found that the primary signal for NarP - dependent aeg - 46.5 operon induction is nitrite rather than nitrate .	RI
8501030	29	3259 This shows that the NarL protein represses aeg - 46 .	RI
8501030	154	These results show that the NarP protein activates F ( aeg - 46.5 - lacZ ) expression in response to nitrate and nitrite and that the NarL protein antagonizes this activation .	RI
8631699	185	However , repression in the presence of oxygen or nitrate was significantly reduced with respect to the monocopy fusion , which suggests that an increase in the copy number of caiF renders transcription of the gene less dependent on the anaerobic regulators FNR and NarL .	RI
8631699	257	The presence of FNR and CRP consensus sequences upstream of caiF is consistent with the activation of transcription of a caiF - lacZ fusion by these two proteins ( Table 3 ) .	RI
8631699	270	When the CaiF protein was overproduced , the pattern of induction of carnitine dehydratase activity was shown to escape from the control of the histone - like protein H - NS and the alternate sigma transcription factor S and to rely primarily on the stimulatory effect of CaiF .	RI

9335308	147	Nitrate and nitrite induction of cydD is dependent on NarL and Fnr .	RI
9335308	156	For example , the nitrate reductase genes narGHJI are regulated exclusively by NarL and are not responsive to NarP as observed here for cydD , while nitrate induction of the fdnGHI operon is regulated predominantly by NarL but is also responsive in part to NarP ( 33 , 39 ) .	RI
9335308	207	The dps promoter is activated by OxyR during growth and by IHF and s in stationary phase .	RI
9852003	12	The dcuB gene is strongly activated anaerobically by FNR , repressed in the presence of nitrate by NarL , and subject to cyclic AMP receptor protein ( CRP ) - mediated catabolite repression .	RI
9852003	45	Expression of fumB is also induced anaerobically ( 1.5 - or 5 - fold ) in a manner which is dependent on both FNR and ArcA ( 41 , 44 ) .	RI
9852003	59	The results show that the dcuB gene is expressed exclusively under anaerobic conditions in a manner that is FNR dependent and that it is repressed by NarL in the presence of nitrate and is subject to CRP - mediated catabolite repression .	RI
9852003	170	Both the aerobic and anaerobic expression levels of dcuB were only ca . twofold lower in the arcA mutant ( JRG3841 ) , indicating that ArcA plays no more than a minor role in regulating dcuB expression in response to oxygen ( Fig . 5B ) and that ArcA is not responsible for the FNR - independent mechanism of anaerobic activation of dcuB transcription .	RI
9852003	183	This demonstrates that NarL has the major role in nitrate - induced repression of dcuB expression ( Fig . 5Dii ) .	RI
9852003	261	The organization of the putative NarL sites in the dcuB operator - promoter region clearly does not conform to the preferred 7 - 2 - 7 arrangement , which is consistent with the observation that NarL , but not NarP , represses dcuB expression .	RI
9852003	286	The dcuB gene is expressed exclusively under anaerobic conditions in a manner that is largely FNR dependent , is repressed by nitrate through a mechanism that is mostly NarL mediated , and is strongly induced by C 4 - dicarboxylates anaerobically .	RI
9852003	736	Transcriptional co - activation at the ansB promoters : involvement of the activating regions of CRP and FNR when bound in tandem .	RI
15995204	53	The phospho - DcuR protein is known to activate the transcription of three operons : the dcuB - fumB operon encoding the DcuB carrier and fumarase B , the frd - ABCD operon encoding fumarate reductase ( Fig . 1C ) , and the dctA gene encoding the aerobic C 4 - dicarboxylate transporter ( 2 , 17 , 18 , 67 ) .	RI
15995204	56	Additionally , nitrate , acting via the NarL response regulator , represses the transcription of the frdA and dcuB - fumB operons ( Fig . 1C ) ( 18 , 22 , 27 , 53 ) .	RI
15995204	177	We also monitored expression from a previously constructed ( frdA - lacZ ) gene fusion for which both Dcumediated activation and Nar - mediated repression are well documented .	RI
15995204	198	This indicates that the NarX - NarL system is solely responsible for nitrate repression of these four operons ( dcuB - fumB , aspA , frdABCD , and dcuSR ) involved in fumarate respiration .	RI
15995204	217	More recently , the DcuS - DcuR regulatory system has been identified as mediating dicarboxylate - responsive activation of frdA operon transcription ( 17 , 67 ) .	RI
15995204	222	Expression from a monocopy ( dcuS - lacZ ) operon fusion revealed three - to fourfold repression by nitrate ( Table 2 ) , virtually all of which can be attributed to the NarX - NarL regulatory system rather than the paralogous NarQ - NarP system ( data not shown ) .	RI
15995204	239	Thus , the dcuSR operon control region contains an authenticated 7 - 2 - 7 heptamer pair for phospho - NarL binding overlapping the likely 35 region of the promoter ( Fig . 2B ) and therefore positioned appropriately to effect the observed repression ( Table 2 ) .	RI
16261196	164	NorR is a r 54 - dependent transcriptional activator that regulates expression of the NO reductase operons , norVW in E . coli and norAB in R . eutropha [ 21,22 ] .	RI
16261196	189	In agreement with these findings , the nitrate - and nitrite - induced transcription from the hcp promoter in E . coli was found to depend on the response regulator proteins NarL and NarP [ 45 ] .	RI
16261196	239	NorR usually regulates cytoplasmic NO reductase norVW and sometimes another membrane - bound NO reductase ( norB ) and the NO dioxygenase hmp .	RI
16261196	288	Moreover , a common inverted repeat sequence coincided with the defined here NsrR recognition motif was shown to be involved in NsrR - mediated repression of the ytfE gene .	RI
17449618	9	Microarray analysis revealed that NsrR represses nine operons encoding 20 genes in Escherichia coli MG1655 , including the hmpA , ytfE , and ygbA genes that were previously shown to be regulated by NsrR .	RI
17449618	15	As hmpA and ytfE encode a nitric oxide reductase and a mechanism to repair iron - sulfur centers damaged by nitric oxide , the demonstration that hcp - hcr , hmpA , and ytfE are the three transcripts most tightly regulated by NsrR highlights the possibility that the hybrid cluster protein , HCP , might also be part of a defense mechanism against reactive nitrogen stress .	RI
17449618	29	The fourth promoter predicted to be regulated by NsrR was P hcp , the promoter of a two - gene operon encoding the hybrid cluster protein , HCP , and its reductase , HCR .	RI
17449618	105	Operons observed to be differentially expressed include not only all four of the transcripts , hmpA , ytfE , ygbA , and hcp - hcr , known or predicted to be NsrR - regulated ( 4 , 40 ) , but also other transcripts predicted to be regulated by nitrite or RNS generated from nitrite , for example , nitric oxide ( 11 ) .	RI
17449618	110	In the case of the ydbC promoter , the differences in transcript levels between the two transformants were at least as great as those for the NsrRrepressed genes , making P ydbE a prime candidate for direct activation by NsrR .	RI
17449618	112	The microarray data for the other promoters that are apparently activated by NsrR must be evaluated cautiously , however , because few of these transcripts encode proteins known or suspected to be involved in the response to RNS , and most of the differences were much smaller ( typically two - to threefold apparent activation ) than the 30 - fold repression of ytfE , the 14 - fold repression of hmpA , and the up - to - 15 - fold repression of hcp .

RI
19245365	187	Thus we propose that , under conditions where Fis levels are raised , Fis binds at the yeaR promoter and prevents nitrate - dependent induction by blocking NarL binding to its target ( illustrated in Figure 6A ) .	RI
19245365	189	In the second part of the present study , we investigated the E . coli ogt promoter , which Constantinidou et al . [ 11 ] had also found to be induced by NarL independently of FNR .	RI
19245365	203	In ( B ) and ( C ) , the hypersensitive site at position 76 that is induced by NarL binding to NarL I is marked with a star , and the Fis - induced hypersensitive site at position 90 is marked by a filled circle . results confirm that the ogt promoter is induced by NarL in response to nitrate ions , without help from FNR .	RI
19245365	209	Although there is no simple rationale for why the yeaR and ogt promoters are also repressed by Fis , we suggest that rapidly growing cells may opt out of certain stress responses , and we speculate that RNS may be a small risk in these conditions compared with other stresses .	RI
19245365	231	We suggest that the induction of ogt by NarL alone in response to external nitrate provides a prophylactic insurance policy against possible genotoxic effects arising from nitrate metabolism .	RI
19245365	232	As at the yeaR promoter , nitrate - dependent induction can be repressed by Fis that binds to a single site overlapping the upstream DNA site for NarL .	RI
10850996	13	We identified eight genes and confirmed that seven are transcriptionally activated by normal expression of Rob from the chromosomal rob gene ( inaA , marR , aslB , ybaO , mdlA , yfhD , and ybiS ) .	RI
10850996	14	One gene , galT , was repressed by Rob .	RI
10850996	36	E - mail : m . h . j . bennik @ ato . wag - ur . nl . have shown that overexpression of Rob ( or its N - terminal domain alone ) activates transcription of sodA ( encoding manganese - containing superoxide dismutase ) , fumC ( encoding fumarase C ) , inaA ( encoding a weak acid - inducible protein ) , and micF ( gene for an antisense RNA repressing the outer membrane porin OmpF ) .	RI
10850996	39	The Rob homologs MarA and SoxS can activate transcription of a broad range of genes in vivo ( reviewed in references 2 and 14 ) , including sodA , fumC , micF , zwf , and inaA , suggesting broadly overlapping activities of these three regulators .	RI
10850996	155	Both inaA and marRAB are known Rob - regulated genes ( 5 , 21 ) .	RI
10850996	212	Our analysis revealed that inaA , marRAB , aslB , ybaO , mdlA , yfhD , and ybiS were transcriptionally activated by constitutive levels of Rob , while galT expression was repressed .	RI
10850996	213	Rob contributes significantly to the expression of the marRAB operon , which regulates the intrinsic resistance of E . coli to various antibiotics , bactericidal agents , and organic solvents ( 5 , 10 , 13 ) .	RI
10850996	216	Other genes reported to be activated by Rob in vitro ( fpr , fumC , micF , nfo , sodA , and zwf ) ( 15 ) or by Rob overexpression in vivo ( fumC , inaA , micF , and sodA ) ( 5 ) were not found in our study ; thus , it appears that the mutagenesis and screening procedure was not saturating .	RI
10850996	217	Among functions that could contribute to cellular resistance to environmental agents , Rob enhances expression of mdlA , which encodes a multiple - drug - resistance - like ATP - binding component of a transport system ( 3 ) , and strongly enhances expression of micF , the antisense RNA that downregulates the outer membrane porin OmpF .	RI
10850996	223	Several Rob - regulated genes , such as marA , noted above , seem to encode other regulatory proteins .	RI

20023096	46	We found that this repression is AraC dependent and is most likely due to binding by arabinose - bound AraC to the xylose promoters , with consequent inhibition of gene expression .	RI
20023096	117	When bound with arabinose , AraC activates the transcription of the araBAD , araE , and araFGH operons and represses transcription from the araC operon .	RI
20023096	134	On the other hand , activation of the P araB promoter was delayed when glucose was present , consistent with the regulation of this promoter also by CRP ( 6 ) .	RI
20023096	211	Based on our results with the arabinose transporter deletion strains , arabinose likely inhibits xylose gene expression by one of two mechanisms : either ( i ) arabinose - bound AraC binds to the P xylA promoter and prevents it from being activated by xylose - bound XylR or ( ii ) arabinose directly binds XylR and inhibits its activity .	RI
20023096	256	Given the proximity of this binding site to the start site for transcription , these results suggest a model where AraC sterically inhibits the binding of XylR and RNA polymerase to the P xylA promoter , consistent with our experimental results .	RI

1744033	132	The facts that arabinose induces the substantial transcription of araJ messenger ( 11 ) and that this transcription is regulated by CAP and AraC ( 11 , 18 ) are , however , consistent with araJ actually being translated and serving some purpose in the arabinose metabolism of E . coli .

1447222	19	It has been proposed that araFGH and araE are also negatively regulated by AraC protein in the absence of arabinose ( 9 ) .	RI
1447222	27	In the absence of arabinose , AraC protein represses araBAD transcription by a mechanism involving cooperative binding of AraC protein to two AraC binding sites at a distance , resulting in formation of a DNA loop ( 15 - 19 , 39 , 40 ) .	RI
1447222	342	The repression of the araBAD operon occurs by cooperative interaction between two distal AraC binding sites araOz and urd ( 19 , 39,40 ) .	RI

RI
19906180	2	Summary In vivo and in vitro analyses indicate that transcription of the argO gene coding for an arginine exporter is regulated by the global transcriptional regulator Lrp , an effect that went by unnoticed in previous genome - scale screenings of the Lrp regulatory network in Escherichia coli .	RI
19906180	4	Activation by Lrp interferes with the previously demonstrated activation of the argO promoter by ArgP .	RI
19906180	10	Combined , the effector modulated activation of argO transcription by ArgP and Lrp must ensure an adapted and fine - tuned synthesis of the transporter in response to environmental conditions .	RI
19906180	49	Expression of the E . coli argO gene is activated by ArgP , also known as IciA , which is a transcriptional activator of the LysR type transcriptional regulator family ( Nandineni and Gowrishankar , 2004 ; Laishram and Gowrishankar , 2007 ) .	RI
19906180	53	More recently , ArgP was shown to bind to an approximately 60 - bp - long sequence partially overlapping the argO promoter ( Fig . 1 ; Laishram and Gowrishankar , © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 74 , 1513 – 1526Lrp and ArgP activation of argO transcription 1515 2007 ) .	RI
19906180	54	ArgP is able to bind the argO control region by itself , but arginine is required to stimulate transcription whereas lysine counteracts this effect ( Laishram and Gowrishankar , 2007 ) .	RI
19906180	65	Results Lrp stimulates argO expression in a leucine - sensitive manner The fact that Lrp affects the expression of many genes involved in the metabolism and transport of amino acids , including the artPIQM operon involved in arginine uptake ( Hung et al . , 2002 ; Tani et al . , 2002 ; Cho et al . , 2008 ) , and our interest in establishing a coherent global picture of the regulation of arginine metabolism in E . coli ( Caldara et al . , Fig . 2 .

19906180	101	Furthermore , we have demonstrated that Lrp - mediated activation of P argO is also operative , and even more efficient , in an argP deletion mutant ( see below ) .	RI
19906180	105	The L - leucine concentration was set at 7 mM , corresponding to the concentration of total leucine in cells grown in © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 74 , 1513 – 1526Lrp and ArgP activation of argO transcription 1517 leucine - supplemented medium ( Quay et al . , 1977 ) .	RI
19906180	108	This complex binding pattern and its Lrp concentration - dependent profile strongly suggest the cooperative binding of Lrp dimers to multiple binding sites in the argO control region and the formation of complexes with a different stoichiometry .	RI
19906180	114	In silico analyses and experimental verification of potential binding sites for Lrp in the argO control region The formation of multiple Lrp – argO operator complexes with a different apparent stoichiometry suggests the existence of several binding sites for Lrp in the argO control region .	RI
19906180	116	Three potential Lrp binding sites can be found in the argO control region ( Pot - box 1 , 2 and 3 ; Fig . 1 ) .	RI
19906180	124	For example , binding of Lrp to the isolated strong binding site 2 of the ilvIH control region occurred in the nM range ( Cui et al . , 1996 ) but , in contrast , binding to site 2 of the pap operon could not be detected by EMSA , although this site was successfully used for the growth of co - crystals ( de los Rios and Perona , 2007 ) .	RI
19906180	138	DNase I footprinting of Lrp binding to the argO control region ( top strand revealed ) without and with 7 mM L - leucine in the binding buffer .	RI
19906180	166	Since both Lrp and ArgP stimulate argO expression and bind to overlapping targets in the argO control region , we were interested in analysing potential interferences in the action of these transcriptional activators on argO expression , in response to environmental conditions .	RI
19906180	168	The major conclusions are that : ( i ) both Lrp and ArgP stimulate P argO in an effector - dependent manner , but to a different extent , ( ii ) the two regulators behave as competitive activators , and ( iii ) ArgP is intrinsically a more potent activator for P argO as compared with Lrp .	RI
19906180	170	The role of endogenous arginine in ArgP - mediated activation of P argO on minimal medium is corroborated by the higher promoter activity in the DargR background ( 2.4 - fold ) which is hardly further increased by exogenous arginine ( Fig . 6 ) .	RI
19906180	200	The cooperative binding of Lrp to the argO control region and the footprinting data ( Figs 3 and 4 ) suggest the binding of at least three Lrp dimers to regularly spaced binding sites ( Fig . 1 ) and wrapping of the operator DNA .	RI
19906180	205	According to the classification of Cho et al . ( 2008 ) , argO belongs to the category of genes that are regulated in a reciprocal manner by Lrp and leucine , i . e .	RI
19906180	207	Interestingly , many other transporters for amino acids such as the uptake genes for arginine ( artPIQM ) , serine ( sdaC ) , alanine ( cycA ) and proline ( proY ) , and the export gene for leucine ( leuE ) are also regulated reciprocally by Lrp and leucine ( Kutukova et al . , 2005 ; Cho et al . , 2008 ) .	RI
19906180	209	In contrast , several transporters for aromatic amino acids ( brnQ , ilvKHMGF and ilvJHMGF ) appear to be regulated by the concerted mode , their expression is downregulated by Lrp and leucine potentiates this effect ( Cho et al . , 2008 ) .	RI
19906180	210	The artPIQM operon is , besides being downregulated by Lrp ( Hung et al . , 2002 ) , also repressed by ArgR ( Caldara et al . , 2007 ) .	RI
19906180	220	In the absence of ArgP , both the affinity of Lrp for the argO control region and its concentration in the cell would be sufficiently high to ensure Lrp - mediated activation of P argO , even in the presence of excess leucine .	RI
19906180	228	The modulation of ArgP - mediated activation of P argO by arginine and lysine ensures that the exporter is only synthesized in significant amounts in conditions of both high arginine and low lysine concentrations ( and not when both concentrations are high ) .	RI

RI
17504942	22	In vivo studies with argO - lac fusions have established that argO is under the strict transcriptional control of ArgP ( a member of the LysR family of regulator proteins [ Schell 1993 ] ) , and that its expression is induced by 1 mM Arg as well as by its toxic analog canavanine ( CAN , which is a plant derived naturally occurring antimetabolite ) ( Nandineni and Gowrishankar 2004 ) .	RI
17504942	37	Our results indicate that whereas ArgP activates argO transcription in the presence of Arg through the process of RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) recruitment ( Ptashne and Gann 1997 ; Browning and Busby 2004 ) , the mechanism by which Lys addition phenocopies an argP mutation is not simply by preventing the binding of ArgP to the argO operator but instead by reversible trapping of the recruited RNAP at the promoter in a novel molecular complex that is proficient for neither productive nor abortive transcription .

RI
17504942	62	Although a 26 - bp near - perfect palindromic region from 102 to 77 exists upstream of argO ( see Fig . 1A ) , neither its deletion ( designated 1 ) nor that of an overlapping 1260 GENES &amp; DEVELOPMENT upstream region from 115 to 90 ( designated 2 ) led to any significant loss of either ArgP binding to argO in vitro ( Fig . 2B ) or to Arg - and Lys - modulated transcriptional regulation in vivo ( Fig . 1B , top panel ) .	RI
17504942	65	Since the results above suggested that the argO regulatory region upstream of 89 is not required for ArgP binding , we tested fragments with increasing length of downstream sequence in the EMSA experiments .	RI

18502871	102	Upon transformation into strain JCP75 , this plasmid led to red colonies on MacConkey lactose agar plates supplemented with lysine , confirming that ArgP is able to enhance dapB transcription .	RI
18502871	112	As shown in Fig . 2 , induction of ArgP synthesis was soon followed by a sharp stimulation of dapBlacZ transcription .	RI
18502871	113	Altogether , these data indicate that ArgP is able to activate transcription from the dapB promoter , provided that some sequences upstream of 81 are present , and is necessary for lysine to repress dapB expression .	RI
18502871	115	To further investigate ArgP - mediated activation of dapB transcription , we purified His - tagged ArgP protein ( 17 ) and used it to perform EMSE .	RI
18502871	125	ArgP binds a site upstream of the dapB promoter .	RI
18502871	132	Samples were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel , run , and analyzed by autoradiography . gave a single retarded band of mobility similar to that observed with purified His 6 - ArgP protein , whereas crude extracts devoid of ArgP gave no retarded band ( Fig . 3B ; see also Fig . 5A ) , indicating that no protein other than ArgP is able to bind significantly to the dapB promoter region .	RI
18502871	151	There is a strict correlation between the presence of ArgP and a high level of lysine - repressed dapB transcription , provided that the dapB regulatory region contains the necessary cis - acting upstream sequences .	RI

15150242	29	Based on data from in vitro studies , Celis suggested that wild - type ArgP both represses its own transcription and activates that of argK ; he also sought to explain the Can r phenotype associated with the argP d mutation on the assumption that it is a loss - of - function ( that is , dominant - negative ) allele whose product is unable to efficiently activate the genes involved in Arg uptake , including argK ( 12 ) .	RI
15150242	35	We show in this study that strains with null mutations in either argP or yggA exhibit abnormally increased sensitivities to CAN ( Can ss ) and that ArgP is a transcriptional regulator of yggA that mediates the latter ’ s induction by Arg .	RI
15150242	46	Our results indicate that yggA encodes an ArgP - regulated Arg exporter in E . coli .	RI
15150242	191	( iii ) The transcription of yggA in vivo is ArgP dependent and is induced by exogenous Arg or Arg - Ala ( and also by an argR mutation ) , whereas the addition of Lys or Lys - Ala phenocopies the effect of an argP null mutation ; furthermore , yggA expression is rendered constitutive in an argP d strain .	RI
15150242	194	Therefore , a straightforward interpretation of our results , as further discussed below , is that ( i ) ArgP is a transcriptional activator of yggA , ( ii ) ArgP ’ s activator function is enhanced by Arg and inhibited by Lys , and ( iii ) yggA encodes an Arg ( and CAN ) exporter in E . coli .	RI
15150242	197	The model proposed by Celis ( 11 , 12 ) to explain the Can r phenotype of an argP d mutant assumed ( i ) that the mutation represents a loss - of - function ( that is , dominant - negative ) allele of argP and ( ii ) that wild - type ArgP is a transcriptional activator of argK , whose product in turn acts to enhance Arg uptake through two different transport systems .	RI
15150242	199	Furthermore , even the finding of Celis ( 12 ) that argK is a target for transcriptional activation by ArgP may need to be reexamined , given that ( i ) there is a discrepancy between the expected argK runoff transcript size ( approximately 310 bases ) determined from the promoter mapping data published by Celis et al . in an earlier paper ( 13 ) and that reported by him ( 215 bases ) for ArgP activation experiments ( 12 ) and ( ii ) the promoter ( for argK ) mapped by his group ( 13 ) is within the argK coding region per the genome sequence published by Blattner et al .

21441513	152	To evaluate whether ArgP was involved in the transcriptional regulation of lysP , a nonfunctional argP allele ( argP : : Cam r ) was transduced into strain MG - LR carrying the chromosomal P lysP : : lacZ fusion .	RI
21441513	155	To confirm the role of ArgP in the regulation of lysP transcription , the argP gene was cloned into plasmid pBAD24 under the control of the arabinose - inducible promoter ( 18 ) .	RI
21441513	165	These results indicated that ArgP is responsible for the transcriptional activation of lysP in the absence of lysine .	RI
21441513	188	To determine whether ArgP directly regulates lysP transcription , we tested binding of ArgP to the lysP promoter / control region .	RI
21441513	197	As already mentioned , a potential ArgP - binding site , ATG AAGGTGTCTTAT , is centered at position 59 in the lysP promoter / control region ( Fig . 2 ) .	RI
21441513	201	To study the ArgP - binding site in the lysP promoter / control region in more detail , DNase I footprinting analysis was performed in the absence and presence of lysine ( Fig . 5 ) .	RI
21441513	220	So far , our results demonstrate that ArgP directly binds to the lysP promoter / control region and that the T - N 11 - A sequence located close to the RNA polymerase binding site is important for binding and crucial for lysP transcription .	RI
21441513	231	This scenario is plausible , because ArgP and Lrp competitively activate argO ( 35 ) .	RI
21441513	255	Lrp stimulates transcription of lysP by direct binding to its control region .	RI
21441513	270	Peeters et al . have recently demonstrated that argP expression was not regulated by Lrp ( 35 ) .	RI
21441513	288	However , under inducing conditions , the P cadBA activity in the lrp : : Km r mutant strain was 2 - fold lower than that in the parent strain , suggesting that Lrp stimulates expression of cadBA .	RI
21441513	310	Together , these results indicate that Lrp upregulates expression of cadBA .	RI
21441513	322	ArgP of E . coli is also responsible for the lysine - dependent regulation of dapB , which encodes one of the enzymes of the diaminopimelate and lysine biosynthesis pathway ( 2 ) , and argO , which encodes the arginine exporter ArgO ( 24 , 30 ) .	RI
21441513	323	It is important to note that the molecular mechanisms of lysinedependent regulation by ArgP differ between argO and dapB ( 2 , 24 ) .	RI
21441513	345	The ArgP - binding site for argO extends up to nucleotide 20 and thereby overlaps the 35 promoter motif , whereas the ArgP - binding site for lysP extends up to position 47 , which is upstream of the 35 promoter site ( Fig . 2 ) .	RI

21441513	372	Recently , the implication of Lrp in the regulation of the gene encoding the arginine exporter ( argO ) was reported .	RI
21441513	375	Here , we found that Lrp binds to several sites at the lysP control region and is able to potentiate the transcriptional activation mediated by ArgP when lysine becomes limiting .	RI
21441513	376	Considering the in vivo and in vitro data presented in this work , the mechanism by which ArgP regulates argO transcription ( 24 ) , and the known capacity of Lrp to alter the shape of the DNA by inducing bending and wrapping ( 57 ) , a model for lysP regulation in which binding of Lrp to the lysP control region may favor and / or stabilize the ArgP - RNA polymerase - DNA complexes or introduce DNA conformational changes is conceivable .

RI
15066032	7	Expression of the chb operon is repressed by NagC , which regulates genes involved in amino sugar metabolism .	RI
15066032	15	The need for two specific inducing signals , one for ChbR to activate the expression of the operon and a second for NagC to relieve its repression , ensure that the chb operon is only induced when there is sufficient flux through the combined chb - nag metabolic pathway to activate expression of both the chb and nag operons .	RI
15066032	110	This shows that whereas both NagC and ChbR appear to act as repressors for the chbB operon in the absence of the inducing sugar chitobiose , ChbR is necessary for induction and so behaves as a dual - function repressor – activator .	RI
15066032	128	We can deduce that cellobiose - 6P is capable of generating an inducing signal for ChbR but not an inducing signal for NagC and that induction of both regulators is necessary for derepressed expression of the chb operon .	RI
15066032	129	The role of CAP in induction Expression of the chbB – lacZ fusion during growth on glycerol was only slightly higher than that on glucose in the wild - type strain , which is not typical of a cAMP / CAP - regulated gene ( Table 1 ) .	RI
15066032	133	Thus the role of CAP is to act in concert with ChbR to activate expression of the chb operon .	RI
15066032	168	Further evidence that growth on chitin is limiting for induction of NagC is shown by the analysis of the effect of chitin and chitobiose on induction of a NagC - regulated nagB – lacZ fusion .	RI
15066032	172	Repression by NagC and ChbR in vivo A plasmid overexpressing ChbR produces very strong repression of the chbB – lacZ fusion in a wild - type strain ( 37 - fold ) , whereas a plasmid overexpressing NagC produces less than twofold repression ( Table 5 ) .	RI
15066032	173	In a nagC strain , the threefold increase in chbB – lacZ expression compared with the wild type is , as expected , eliminated by the NagC plasmid .	RI
15066032	177	So there is no strong repression of chbB – lacZ by plasmid - encoded NagC .	RI

RI
15066032	276	Compared with other operons regulated by NagC , nagE - BACD and glmUS , it is very likely that the repression complex involves an interaction between NagC bound to its two sites , NagC1 and NagC2 , so that a DNA loop is formed .	RI

10601201	15	Our results show that the fucPIK promoter , a complex promoter which ordinarily depends on both CRP and the fucose - specific regulator FucR for its activation , can be activated in the absence of FucR by a mutant CRP that uses three , rather than two , activating regions to contact RNA polymerase .	RI
10601201	180	The CRP K52N mutant possesses a third activating region , designated AR3 ( small black triangle ) , that has been proposed to contact the subunit ( see text ) . contrast to CRP , which effectively activated the wild - type fucPIK promoter only in the presence of fucose but failed to activate the IS5 - disrupted promoter in the presence or absence of fucose , as previously reported ( 8 ) .	RI
10601201	184	These findings indicate that , whereas the binding of wild - type CRP to site 1 is not sufficient to activate transcription from the fucPIK promoter , binding of CRP K52N is sufficient , at least for the IS5 - disrupted promoter .	RI

RI
14593252	6	The results presented allow us to speculate that GntR initiates expression of the GntII genes , followed by their large induction by GntH when cells were grown in gluconate minimum medium .	RI
14593252	11	These genes for the GntI system have been extensively characterized and shown to be regulated negatively by GntR and positively by the cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) - cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) complex [ Tong et al . , 1996 ; Izu et al . , 1997a , b ; Porco et al . , 1997 ; Peekhaus and Conway , 1998 ] .	RI
14593252	20	Recently , we have uncovered a unique regulation that the activator of GntII genes , GntH , exerts negative control of GntI genes [ Tsunedomi et al . , 2003 ] .	RI
14593252	28	Bausch et al . [ 1998 ] provided biochemical evidence that the idnD and idnO genes in GntII encode idonate dehydrogenase , oxidizing idonate to 5 - ketogluconate and 5 - ketogluconate reductase , reducing 5 - ketogluconate to gluconate , respectively , and that the GntII system is induced by GntH in the presence of idonate or 5 - ketogluconate .	RI
14593252	30	In the present study , we have shown not only the positive regulation by GntH , but also a negative and positive regulation by GntR , a repressor for the GntI system , of the GntII genes .	RI
14593252	35	In the first point , such a case has been reported in the galETK ( M ) operon concerning galactose utilization , which is regulated by GalR and GalS [ Weickert and Adhya , 1993a b ] , but its molecular mechanism is clearly different from that of the GntII gene regulation .	RI
14593252	36	In the second point , there is also an example that AraC positively and negatively regulates the araBAD operon , the mechanism of which might be similar to some extent to that of the GntII regulation .	RI
14593252	101	This stimulates us to examine the possibility that GntR is also involved in the expressional regulation of the GntII genes .	RI
14593252	105	These results suggest that GntR negatively regulates the expression of the GntII genes .	RI
14593252	111	Positive Effect of GntR in the Expression of the GntII Genes In addition to the negative effect of GntR , the evidence suggesting the positive regulation by GntR of the GntII genes was obtained by expression analysis in minimum medium containing gluconate ( table 2 ) .	RI
14593252	194	Discussion In the previous study , we found the cross - regulation between GntI and GntII systems through GntH as a positive regulator for the GntII genes , which negatively controls the expression of GntI genes [ Tsunedomi et al . , 2003 ] .	RI
14593252	195	The negative regulation by GntH may allow the GntI gene expression to cease after the maximum expression level and its positive regulation causes induction of the GntII genes .	RI
14593252	202	Additionally , GntR may also activate the expression of GntII genes when gluconate is present in minimum medium ( table 2 and fig . 4B ) .	RI
14593252	219	This and the finding that expression of gntV - lacZ fusion was relatively high even in the absence of cAMP ( table 4 ) may suggest that binding of GntR to all 3 sites slightly activates gntV expression .	RI

18346968	106	To measure MelR - dependent repression of melR promoter activity , the pRW50 derivatives carrying the TB20 , TB22 , TB23 or TB10 fragments were transformed into WAM1321 melR lac cells containing either pJW15 , encoding melR , or empty control vector , pJWmelR and b - galactosidase activities were measured .	RI
18346968	109	In contrast , and in full agreement with the previous results of Wade et al . ( 17 ) , the longer deletion in the TB23 fragment , that removes MelR binding site 2 , results in a sharp reduction in the repression of the melR promoter by MelR .	RI

18346968	206	In vitro studies of MelR binding at the melR promoter Our results show that MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter is contingent on MelR binding to site R and is somehow modulated by MelR binding to upstream sites 2 , 1 and 1 0 .	RI

10747919	27	Recent studies ( 11 ) have shown that the occupation of site 2 by MelR is the most crucial for the activation of the melAB promoter , but that , of the four target sites , site 2 binds MelR most weakly .	RI
10747919	29	This suggested that the increased melAB expression in the W3133 - 2 mutant could be due to better binding of MelR to site 2 .	RI

8010957	145	This shows that we had failed to identify MelR mutants with improved specificity for the changed KK433 MelR - binding sequences ; mutants with specificity for the KK433 sequence would have given lower levels of activation with the wild - type melAB promoter .	RI
16621812	8	Busby * School of Biosciences , University of Birmingham , Edgbaston , Birmingham B15 2TT , United Kingdom Received 29 December 2005 / Accepted 10 February 2006 Transcription of the Escherichia coli melAB operon is regulated by the MelR protein , an AraC family member whose activity is modulated by the binding of melibiose .	RI
16621812	13	MelR carrying each of the single substitutions is less able to repress the melR promoter , while MelR carrying some combinations of substitutions is completely unable to repress the melR promoter .	RI
16621812	14	These results argue that different conformational states of MelR are responsible for activation of the melAB promoter and repression of the melR promoter .	RI
16621812	15	Supporting evidence for this is provided by the isolation of substitutions in MelR that block melibiose - dependent activation of the melAB promoter while not changing melibiose - independent repression of the melR promoter .	RI
16621812	36	It has been proposed ( 30 ) that repression requires the formation of a DNA loop that is stabilized by MelR binding at site R and site 2 and that the presence of melibiose breaks this loop , resulting in derepression of pmelR , occupation of site 2 , and induction of pmelAB ( Fig . 1 ) .	RI
16621812	37	Thus , melibiose toggles MelR between a state where it represses pmelR and is unable to activate pmelAB to a state where pmelR is derepressed and pmelAB is activated .	RI
16621812	86	Activities were used to measure MelR - dependent activation of pmelAB and MelR - dependent repression of pmelR .	RI
16621812	94	We previously showed that MelR - dependent activation of pmelAB could be readily monitored using the low - copy - number , broadhost - range lac fusion plasmid pRW50 , carrying the KK43 pmelAB promoter fragment ( KK43 - pRW50 ) ( 2 ) .	RI
16621812	100	Plasmid pJW15 was used to supply MelR to activate expression of the pmelAB : : lac fusion carried by KK43 - pRW50 .	RI
16621812	103	Table 3 lists - galactosidase activity measurements , which showed that pmelAB activity is very low in the absence of melibiose and that melibiose triggers a 50 - fold increase in pmelAB activity that is MelR dependent .	RI
16621812	136	The simplest explanation of our data is that melibiose switches MelR from a conformation that is unable to activate pmelAB to a conformation that is able to activate pmelAB and that the different MelR substitutions favor adoption of the latter conformation to different extents .	RI
16621812	145	With one exception , each of the different single MelR substitutions results in a small reduction in the MelR - dependent repression of pmelR .	RI
16621812	169	However , this second screening step identified 11 pJW15 derivatives encoding MelR that were still able to repress pmelR , despite being defective in the activation of pmelAB .	RI
16621812	174	In contrast , with four of the mutants ( FL53 , PS81 , TA117 , and ND183 ) , melibiose induces pmelAB activity , but to a lesser level than with wild - type MelR .	RI
16621812	182	We reasoned that the difference between the form of MelR unable to activate pmelAB but competent for repression of pmelR and the alternative form that can activate pmelAB but is unable to repress pmelR might be , in part , due to subunitsubunit interactions .	RI
16621812	200	When triggered by melibiose , wild - type MelR requires the assistance of CRP to activate transcription at pmelAB ( 31 ) .	RI
16621812	206	This shows that MelR carrying these substitutions has a reduced requirement for CRP to activate pmelAB .	RI
16621812	211	This is because activation requires MelR binding to site 2 that overlaps the pmelAB 35 hexamer element , and melibiose is required for wild - type MelR to occupy this site ( 2 ) .	RI
16621812	213	This strong repression is relieved by melibiose and , thus , melibiose toggles MelR between two alternative states , one that activates pmelAB and one that represses pmelR ( Fig . 1B ) .	RI
16621812	216	AraC - dependent transcription regulation has been most studied at the araBAD and araC genes , which are expressed from divergent promoters , paraBAD and paraC , whose transcription start sites are separated by 166 bp .	RI
16621812	226	This model is supported by genetic analyses , notably , mutations that alter amino acids in the AraC N - terminal arm that result in AraC - dependent activation of paraBAD in the absence of arabinose ( 19 , 21 , 22 , 34 , 35 ) .	RI
16621812	249	Since it is likely that MelR - MelR interactions are important for both activation of pmelAB and repression of pmelR , we suppose that that differences recorded in Table 5 are due to differences in these interactions .	RI

10760178	33	Interestingly , AraC - dependent transcription initiation at the araBAD promoter is increased by the cyclic AMP receptor protein ( CRP ) , a well - characterized global regulator , controlled by cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) , that activates the expression of a number of genes in response to a variety of stresses , including glucose starvation ( reviewed by Kolb et al . , 1993 ) .

12675795	8	Summary The Escherichia coli MelR protein is a melibiosetriggered transcription factor , belonging to the AraC family , that activates transcription initiation at the melAB promoter .	RI
12675795	16	In order to simplify our analysis , we exploited an engineered derivative of the melAB promoter in which MelR binding to site 2 and site 2 ¢ , in the absence of CRP , is sufficient for transcription activation .	RI
12675795	40	In previous work , we showed that MelR is a melibioseinduced transcription activator , related to AraC , that is essential for melibiose - induced activation of the E . coli melAB promoter ( Webster et al . , 1989 ) .	RI
12675795	42	MelRdependent activation of the melAB promoter requires the binding of MelR subunits to four 18 bp sites and the binding of a single CRP dimer to a low - affinity target sequence ( Belyaeva et al . , 2000 ; Wade et al . , 2001 ; see Fig . 1A ) .	RI
12675795	179	Measurements of b - galactosidase activities in the resulting transformants indicated that none of the single base changes in MelR binding site 2 significantly affected MelR - dependent activation of the JK22 melAB promoter ( data not shown ) .	RI
12675795	247	For example , with AraC at the araBAD promoter , a combination of genetics and biochemistry has shown that the binding orientation is such that the C - terminally located HTH motif is adjacent to the promoter - 35 element ( Niland et al . , 1996 ) , and that , during activation , AraC binds to two adjacent sites as a direct repeat ( Reeder and Schleif , 1993 ) .

10760179	7	Summary The Escherichia coli MelR protein is a transcription activator that , in the presence of melibiose , activates expression of the melAB operon by binding to four sites located just upstream of the melAB promoter .	RI
10760179	27	AraC is functional as a dimer ; in the presence of arabinose , the conformation of AraC is such that the two subunits of the dimer bind to two adjacent target sites resulting in activation of the araBAD promoter .	RI
10760179	29	This results in the formation of a repression loop and the repression of the araC promoter by AraC ( reviewed by Schleif , 1996 ) .	RI
10760179	31	MelR is essential for induction of the melAB operon that is responsible for melibiose metabolism .	RI
10760179	35	MelR activity is regulated by melibiose , which is required for activation of transcription initiation at the melAB promoter ( Webster et al . , 1989 ) .	RI
10760179	51	We show that the melR promoter is repressed by MelR and that this autoregulation requires MelR binding to Site R .	RI
10760179	53	We propose that , for optimal repression , MelR forms a loop between Site R and Site 2 , and that this loop is broken in the presence of melibiose when the melAB promoter is activated .	RI
10760179	70	The shaded boxes denote 22 bp DNA sites for CRP : one site centered at position 241.5 is responsible for the activation of the melR promoter , while the other , centered at position 2155.5 is involved in activation of the melAB promoter .	RI
10760179	83	However , cells that also contain pJW15 , encoding melR , score clearly as Lac minus , due to the MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter ( i . e . they give pale pink ± white colonies ) .	RI
10760179	87	We reasoned that MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter must be less efficient in these mutants .	RI
10760179	91	Results in Fig . 3 show that , in each case , the single base substitution in the Site R MelR - binding site results in a significant reduction in MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter in both the absence and presence of melibiose .	RI
10760179	92	From this , we conclude that the MelR - binding Site R plays an essential role in MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter .	RI
10760179	112	The figure also shows the measured amount of MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter on the KK81 fragment carrying the different Site R substitutions .	RI
10760179	119	Optimal MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter depends on upstream sequences Transcription initiation of the melR promoter is dependent on the binding of CRP to a 22 bp DNA site centered at position 241.5 , but sequences further upstream are not essential ( Webster et al . , 1988 ) .	RI
10760179	122	The results shown in Fig . 4 indicate that , with the shorter KK101 fragment , repression of the melR promoter by MelR differs from the repression found with the longer KK81 fragment .	RI
10760179	126	We reasoned that some part of the melAB promoter might be responsible for the high level of MelRdependent repression of the melR promoter seen with the KK81 fragment .	RI
10760179	127	To investigate this , we constructed a series of KK81 derivatives carrying different mutations in the melAB promoter ( Table 1 ) and measured the consequences of these mutations on MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter in either the presence of absence of melibiose ( Fig . 5 ) .	RI
10760179	130	Results in Fig . 5 show that MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter is little altered by the changes in Site 1 ( KK81S3 ) or Site 1 0 ( KK81S4 ) .	RI
10760179	133	Thus , when MelR - binding Site 2 is altered in the KK81 fragment , the pattern of MelRdependent repression of the melR promoter is similar to that seen with the shorter KK101 fragment ( Fig . 4 ) .	RI
10760179	136	Repression of the melR promoter carried on different KK81 fragments . The figure shows the degree of MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter carried on the starting KK81 fragment and the mutant derivatives , S2 ± S5 .	RI
10760179	144	However , the situation is not so simple , and , in the absence of melibiose , efficient repression requires DNA sequences upstream of the melR promoter ; in particular , MelRbinding Site 2 is required .	RI
10760179	147	Together with the present results , this suggests a simple model ( illustrated in Fig . 6 ) to explain how MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter is modulated by the elements at the upstream melAB promoter .	RI
10760179	149	The presence of melibiose triggers a conformational change in MelR such that the dimer now occupies Site 2 and Site 2 0 and activation of the melAB promoter ensues .	RI
10760179	171	Model for MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter . In the absence of melibiose , MelR subunits occupy Site R and Site 2 forming a repression loop .	RI
10760179	183	Thus , the melR promoter is not efficiently repressed by MelR and MelR is overexpressed .	RI

11742992	57	Hence , in the absence of MelR , CRP does not activate transcription at the melAB promoter whereas , in the presence of MelR , CRP activates transcription ~ 10 - fold ( Figure 1C ) .	RI
11742992	81	Therefore , we compared transcription activation by wild - type CRP and RH180 CRP at the wild - type melAB promoter and at the promoter containing the substitution at position ± 75 .	RI
11742992	82	As expected , the RH180 substitution had little effect on CRPdependent activation of the wild - type melAB promoter .	RI
11742992	110	Substitutions within CRP that affect transcription activation at the melAB promoter To identify the residues of CRP that are important in transcription activation at the melAB promoter , a library of randomly mutated crp genes was created using error - prone PCR .	RI
11742992	136	Taken together , our results argue that residues Thr158 , Pro160 , Gln164 and Lys166 of CRP participate in transcription activation at the melAB promoter : these residues identify a surface of CRP that overlaps with AR1 ( Figure 4 ) .	RI
11742992	140	Thus , we have investigated the involvement of aCTD in CRP - dependent activation at the melAB promoter by using a preparation of E . coli RNAP , reconstituted with truncated a subunits that lack the C - terminal 73 residues .	RI
11742992	146	However , CRP is able to activate transcription from the melAB promoter with RNAP containing both fulllength and truncated a subunits .	RI
11742992	147	The fact that the same level of CRP - dependent transcription activation is seen in vitro with both RNAP preparations argues that CRP activates transcription at the melAB promoter independently of aCTD .	RI
11742992	149	In order to investigate further the role of residues in and around AR1 in transcription activation at the melAB promoter , we puri ® ed CRP carrying the TI158 substitution that improves CRP - dependent activation of the melAB promoter in vivo .	RI
11742992	162	MelR and CRP interact at the melAB promoter to activate transcription , but this interaction can be exploited to repress transcription ( Figure 3 ) .	RI
11742992	166	Similarly , at the melAB promoter , activation by CRP appears to be dependent on direct protein ± protein interactions with MelR .	RI

8729576	43	This investigation reveals that the similarity sufficient to guarantee homology is hardly found between the regulatory protein and the regulated protein , except for the relation between the repressor RbsR and the regulated operon rbsDACBK , where RbsR has been indicated to show considerable similarity to the ribose binding protein RbsB ( Mauzy &amp; Hermodson , 1992 ) , and for some of the regulatory proteins that are known to be self - regulated at the level of transcription .	RI
8729576	199	In spite of such high similarity , Fnr is associated not with the transport system but with the switching of respiration styles ; i . e . under the anaerobic condition , Fnr activates the transcription of anaerobic enzyme genes , repressing the transcription of oxidase gene ( Spiro &amp; Guest , 1991 ) , together with ArcA , one of the response regulators in Group 1 , that represses the transcription of aerobic respiration enzyme genes ( Iuchi et al . , 1990 ; Iuchi &amp; Lin , 1993 ) .

15743943	111	nanC expression was predicted to be regulated by the two - component regulatory system CpxR - CpxA by transcriptome analysis ( 16 ) .	RI
15743943	134	There is no obvious 35 promoter sequence , but a potential CAP site is detectable on the sequence ( Fig . 1A ) , centered at position 61.5 , which is consistent with the strong catabolite repression observed with the nanC fusion .	RI
15743943	220	However , it is clear that they allow coordination of nanC and fimB expression , since NanR and NagC repress one and activate the other of these divergently arranged genes .	RI
15743943	222	Two other regulators , OmpR and CpxR , activate nanC expression , although a direct control has not been proven .	RI
9469834	53	This is particularly true in the case of nagB , but activation of nagE requires in addition protein – protein interactions between CAP and the RNA polymerase machinery .	RI
9469834	78	The mutation CAP + 6 puts the CAP site at a non - functional distance for nagE ( – 67.5 ) , while the CAP – 6 mutation puts the CAP site at – 65.5 for nagB , also expected to be non - functional for cAMP / CAP activation ( 37,38 ) .	RI
9469834	92	The greater expression of nagB in the CAP + 6 context than in the CAP – 6 case correlates with the fact that activation by CAP is still possible with the CAP + 6 mutation ( the CAP site is still at – 71.5 ) but not at CAP – 6 , where the CAP site is now located at – 66.5 , i . e . on the other side of the DNA helix compared with RNA polymerase ( 5,18 ) .	RI
9469834	93	There is no obvious effect of the CAP + 6 mutation on nagE expression but this is presumably due to two opposing effects which are of similar magnitude : an 10 - to 15 - fold increase in nagE expression due to loss of repressor binding ( equivalent to that seen for the nagB fusion ) and a 10 - to 15 - fold decrease in nagE expression due to a lack of cAMP / CAP activation ( 5 ; see also below ) .	RI
9469834	117	However , cAMP caused a large ( 15 - fold ) stimulation of nagE and a 2.5 - fold stimulation of nagB when the CAP site was located at its functional distance .	RI
9469834	162	This idea seemed a real possibility as similar contacts have been detected in the CytR – cAMP / CAP repression complex at deoP1 ( 44 ; reviewed in 17 ) .	RI
9469834	201	Despite the fact that the residual activity of the CAP pc proteins at the two promoters is different in the induced and uninduced conditions , there is a clear qualitative difference in the response of nagE and nagB to the mutant CAPs : 50 – 100 % activation at nagB and maximally 20 % activation at nagE .

9469834	203	Since the same level of activation is seen with the truncated single operator site nagE – lacZ fusion it implies that no DNA important for CAP stimulation of nagE – lacZ expression is situated beyond – 100 .	RI
9469834	210	This was indeed suggested by Détiollaz et al . ( 49 ) on the basis that IHF sites replacing CAP sites allowed activation of the malT promoter , albeit less than with CAP .	RI
9469834	227	Although the role of CAP in repression of nagE – B is likely to be purely architectural , it is clear that a major part of the CAP activation of nagE is due to protein – protein contacts between CAP and RNA polymerase .	RI
24593230	13	NagC repression is critical in maintaining chiP mRNA levels low enough , relative to ChiX , to allow full silencing by this sRNA .	RI
24593230	44	In addition , the repression of chiP translation by ChiX induces premature Rho - dependent transcription termination within the chiP gene , preventing expression of the chiQ gene ( encoding a putative lipoprotein of unknown function ) located immediately downstream of chiP and normally cotranscribed with the latter ( Bossi et al . , 2012 ) .	RI
24593230	45	In the presence of chitobiose / triose , a metabolite of chitobiose , probably monodeacetylated chitobiose - 6P ( Verma and Mahadevan , 2012 ) , causes the ChbR regulatory protein to activate transcription of the chb operon .	RI
24593230	47	As the chb transcript accumulates , ChiX pairing with the intercistronic chbBC mRNA elicits the degradation of the sRNA resulting in the progressive relief of chiP repression ( Figueroa - Bossi et al . , 2009 ; Overgaard et al . , 2009 ) .	RI
24593230	104	The NagC repressor inhibits chiP transcription under uninduced conditions through binding to the chiP promoter .	RI
24593230	141	However , in both organisms repression of chiP by NagC is inefficient resulting in a relatively high basal level of chiP transcription in the absence of chitobiose ( Figueroa - Bossi et al . , 2009 ) .	RI
24593230	151	In the absence of chitosugars ( uninduced ) the chb , chiP and nag operons are repressed by NagC .	RI
24593230	152	Translation of the chiP mRNA is repressed by base - pairing with the ChiX sRNA .	RI
24593230	161	The latter step is critical for the initiation of the entire induction cascade , as the chbBCARFG operon itself is repressed by NagC ( Plumbridge and Pellegrini , 2004 ) .	RI
24593230	184	This suggested that ChiX pairing with the RNA sequence from the chbB - chbC intercistronic spacer – the very mechanism responsible for ChiX inactivation during chitobiose induction – downregulates chbC expression under uninduced conditions .	RI
24593230	197	First , expression of the inner membrane transporter chbCBA is activated directly by the ChbR protein , which allows entry of Chb - 6P and generation of the specific ChbR - inducing signal ( by action of ChbG enzyme ; Verma and Mahadevan , 2012 ) .	RI
24593230	198	Activation of chbBCA expression by ChbR is essential to relieve ChiX repression of chiP .	RI

RI
1629153	254	The FNR protein is required for fdnGHI and narGHJI operon expression during anaerobic growth , and the NARL protein is required for induction by nitrate ( 4 ; for a review , see reference 25 ) .	RI
2168848	36	We found that expression of the fdnCHI operon was induced anaerobically by nitrate , and required fnr ’ and narL + .	RI
11929525	8	Summary Expression from the Escherichia coli nrfA promoter ( pnrfA ) is activated by both the FNR protein ( an anaerobically triggered transcription activator ) and the NarL or NarP proteins ( transcription activators triggered by nitrite and nitrate ) .	RI
11929525	15	Both Fis and IHF repress in vivo expression from pacsP1 , but have smaller repressive effects on expression from pnrfA .	RI
11929525	35	At the nirB promoter ( pnirB ) , it has been shown that IHF and Fis drive the promoter DNA into an inhibitory architecture , which represses FNR - dependent transcription .	RI
11929525	48	Thus , at pnirB , NarL and NarP activate transcription by an indirect mechanism , rather than by interacting directly with the transcription machinery ( Browning et al . , 2000 ) .	RI
11929525	76	As NarL is capable of repressing pnrfA under certain conditions ( Tyson et al . , 1994 ) , the activities of the cloned promoters were determined in the Dlac narL narP + strain , JCB3883 , so nitrite and nitrate activation would be mediated solely by NarP .	RI
11929525	116	Similarly , incubation of the pnrf97 EcoRI – HindIII fragment with Fis binds to the nrfA – acs intergenic region and represses transcription At the E . coli nirB promoter , transcription initiation is repressed by the association of the nucleoid - associated factors , Fis and IHF ( Wu et al . , 1998 ; Browning et al . , 2000 ) .	RI
11929525	299	For these reasons , we believe that NarL and NarP activate expression at pnrfA by a similar mechanism to that at pnirB , i . e . by counteracting the effects of repressive factors .	RI
11929525	303	In relation to pacsP1 , the DNA site for Fis is centred at position – 61 , and its distal nature suggests that pacsP1 repression operates via a different mechanism .	RI

9696769	16	This suggests that Fnr and NarP may act synergistically to activate napF operon expression .	RI
9696769	54	The inability of NarL to activate napF operon expression led us to hypothesize that NarL is deficient in the mechanism by which NarP activates transcription from the 44.5 binding site ( 9 ) .	RI
9696769	105	This Fnr ( D154A ) protein was able to activate ( napF - lacZ ) expression in vivo ( data not shown ) .	RI
9696769	111	By analogy with Crp - dependent promoters ( 3 ) and synthetic Fnr - dependent promoters ( 29 , 30 ) , we hypothesized that the mechanism by which napF expression is activated by Fnr is distinct from the mechanism involved in the activation of most4194 DARWIN ET AL . J .	RI
9696769	126	When wild - type Fnr was expressed from a multicopy plasmid , ( napF - lacZ ) expression was induced approximately sixfold by anaerobiosis ( Table 1 ) .	RI
9696769	129	With Fnr ( S73F ) , anaerobic activation of ( napF - lacZ ) expression was significantly reduced ( Table 1 ) .	RI
9696769	133	Deletion , mutational , and footprint analyses had indicated that napF operon expression in vivo is induced weakly by either Fnr or NarP alone and strongly by Fnr and NarP together .	RI
9696769	160	In a control experiment , the activity of the Fnr ( D154A ) protein was confirmed by its ability to activate transcription of the Fnr - dependent dmsA promoter in vitro ( data not shown ) .	RI
9696769	170	It is possible that NarP and Fnr may activate napF transcription synergistically whereas Fnr and NarL cannot , as discussed below .	RI
9696769	171	Note that in a control experiment , the activity of the MBP - NarL protein was confirmed by its ability to activate transcription of the NarL - dependent fdnG promoter in vitro ( data not shown ) .	RI
9696769	172	MBP - NarL antagonizes activation of the napF promoter by Fnr ( D154A ) and MBP - NarP in vitro .	RI
9696769	181	DISCUSSION The napF promoter is one of several regulated by Fnr in response to anaerobiosis and by NarL or NarP in response to nitrate and nitrite .	RI
9696769	184	However , the napF control region has a very different architecture , with an Fnr - binding site centered at position 64.5 and activation by NarP being mediated by a binding site downstream , at position 44.5 ( Fig . 1 ) .	RI
9696769	185	In this study we confirmed the location of the Fnr - binding site at position 64.5 and supported the idea that the mechanism of Fnr - dependent activation of napF expression is distinct from that of promoters with the Fnr - binding site at position 41.5 .	RI
9696769	207	The fact that most Fnrdependent promoters have the latter architecture may be due to the fact that many of them are also activated by the NarL protein ( e . g . , the narG , fdnG , nrfA , and nirB promoters ) .	RI
9696769	209	The napF operon provides the only known example of a promoter activated by NarP but not NarL .	RI
9696769	385	Upstream sequence elements required for NarL - mediated activation of transcription from the narGHJI promoter of Escherichia coli .	RI
17720788	31	For the nirBDC and nrfABCDEFG operons , Fnr protein , bound near position 41.5 , activates transcription maximally only when phospho - NarL or - NarP protein is bound further upstream to block inhibition by other proteins ( 2 , 8 , 59 ) .	RI
17720788	256	However , sequence inspection failed to reveal an apparent Fnr protein binding site in the yeaR - yoaG operon control region ( Fig . 1A ) ( 12 , 40 ) , and microarray analysis revealed Fnr - independent induction of yeaR transcription in response to nitrite ( 12 ) .	RI
17720788	287	Recent studies have documented NsrR and Fnr regulation of ytfE ( dnrN ) gene expression patterns similar to those reported here for the yeaR - yoaG operon : NsrR - dependent induction by nitrite and nitric oxide ( or compounds that generate nitric oxide ) and enhanced expression in fnr null strains ( 6 , 20 , 24 ) .	RI
18227264	15	Thus , although the region of the ydhY – T promoter containing the ” 16 and + 15 heptamers was recognized by NarL in vitro , mutation of these heptamers did not affect NarL - mediated repression in vivo .	RI
18227264	222	Consistent with the hypothesis that YdhY – T has a role in anaerobic metabolism , gel retardation , footprinting , sitedirected mutagenesis and transcript - mapping experiments showed that the oxygen - responsive transcription factor FNR directly activates transcription of ydhY – T under anaerobic conditions by binding at a site located at position 242.5 relative to the transcript start , confirming and extending earlier work that shows that ydhY is expressed from a class II FNR - dependent promoter ( Kang et al . , 2005 ) .	RI
18227264	223	Furthermore , ydhY – T expression is regulated by the NarXL and NarPQ nitrate - and nitriteresponsive two - component systems , confirming the results of previous transcription - profiling studies ( Constantinidou et al . , 2006 ) .	RI
18227264	238	Thus , it appears that NarL and NarP adopt overlapping mechanisms to inhibit ydhY – T expression .	RI
18227264	242	NarL - mediated repression of the frdA promoter is achieved by NarL binding over a large region centred near the transcription start site and including the FNR site ( Li et al . , 1994 ) .	RI
18227264	243	Similarly , at the FNR - activated NarL - repressed dmsA promoter NarL protects a large region that includes the sites for both FNR and RNA polymerase binding ( Bearson et al . , 2002 ) .	RI
18227264	244	Thus , NarL - mediated repression of the ydhY promoter follows the general pattern established by the frdA and dmsA promoters .	RI
18227264	250	Nevertheless , in contrast to the ydhY – T promoter , where NarP - mediated repression requires a 7 - 2 - 7 site centred at + 10.5 , occupation of which will probably inhibit RNA polymerase binding , the fdnGHI promoter possesses a NarP - binding 7 - 2 - 7 site centred at 2104.5 that is thought to antagonize activation by NarL ( Wang &amp; Gunsalus , 2003 ) .	RI
18227264	252	The relative degrees of repression of the ydhY – lacZ fusion in the presence of nitrite ( approximately twofold ) or nitrate ( ~ 13 - fold ) suggest that NarL - mediated inhibition of FNR recruitment is a key component of the regulation of the ydhY – T promoter , and that NarP - mediated inhibition of RNA polymerase binding is partially overcome by the ability of FNR to recruit RNA polymerase .	RI
22101843	27	The twocomponent system CitA / CitB of E . coli is supposed to regulate the expression of the genes for citrate fermentation in response to external citrate under anaerobic conditions ( 20 , 52 ) , similarly to the citrate - responsive two - component system CitA / CitB of Klebsiella pneumoniae ( 6 ) .	RI
22101843	123	Thus , the expression of the citCDEFXGT gene cluster of E . coli depends on CitA / CitB , and the system confers induction by citrate in the absence of oxygen and nitrate .	RI
22101843	163	Therefore , the induction of dcuB depends on functional DcuS / DcuR .	RI
22101843	175	However , the inactivation of DcuS ( IMW553 ) led to a decrease of citC - lacZ expression by a factor of 1.5 , which could be due to interaction between CitA and DcuS .	RI
22101843	176	A 3.4 - fold decrease of citC - lacZ induction was observed when DcuR was inactivated ( IMW554 ) .	RI
22101843	177	The impact of DcuR on citC expression might be due to a transcriptional activation of citAB by DcuR , as discussed below .	RI
22101843	281	Nevertheless , CitA is required for the maximal induction of dcuB - lacZ by citrate ( but not by fumarate ) as shown here and earlier ( 25 ) , and DcuS / DcuR is required for the maximal expression of citC - lacZ .	RI
11073923	7	EGAN * Department of Molecular Biosciences , University of Kansas , Lawrence , Kansas 66045 Received 21 August 2000 / Accepted 18 September 2000 The Escherichia coli rhaSR operon encodes two AraC family transcription activators , RhaS and RhaR , and is activated by RhaR in the presence of L - rhamnose . - Galactosidase assays of various rhaS - lacZ promoter fusions combined with mobility shift assays indicated that a cyclic AMP receptor protein ( CRP ) site located at 111.5 is also required for full activation of rhaSR expression .	RI
11073923	8	To address the mechanisms of activation by CRP and the RNA polymerase - subunit C - terminal domain ( - CTD ) at rhaSR , we tested the effects of alanine substitutions in CRP activating regions 1 and 2 , overexpression of a truncated version of ( - 235 ) , and alanine substitutions throughout - CTD .	RI
11073923	32	RhaR regulates transcription of rhaSR by binding promoter DNA spanning 32 to 82 relative to the rhaSR transcription start site .	RI
11073923	34	Upon L - rhamnose induction , RhaR was found to activate rhaSR transcription 5 - fold in vitro ( 35 ) ; however , in vivo measurements indicate that overall rhaSR activation was approximately 440 - fold ( 9 ) .	RI
11073923	35	Subsequent to rhaSR expression , RhaS binds DNA upstream of rhaBAD at 32 to 81 relative to the transcription start site to increase rhaBAD expression by approximately 1,000 - fold ( to 10 Miller units in single copy ) .	RI
11073923	36	An additional 50 - fold activation of rhaBAD expression occurs when CRP occupies its binding site centered at 92.5 , which places CRP adjacent to RhaS ( 9 ) .	RI
11073923	39	To explore the origin of the indirect effect , we tested whether CRP was involved in regulation of rhaSR expression .	RI
11073923	131	RESULTS CRP both directly and indirectly activates rhaBAD .	RI
11073923	132	During the course of our studies on CRP activation of the rhaBAD operon , we compared expression from various rhaBAD promoter fusions ( Fig . 1 ) in crp and crp strain backgrounds .	RI
11073923	148	We hypothesize that CRP binding to some or all of these sites may influence transcription activation at rhaSR .	RI
11073923	161	These results suggest that the DNA region between 90 and 128 is important for activation at rhaSR and that putative CRP sites 2 , 3 , and / or 4 may be functional CRP sites .	RI
11073923	162	Deletion of crp ( Table 5 ) resulted in a level of expression from each fusion that was similar to the expression from ( rhaS - lacZ ) 90 in the crp strain background , supporting our hypothesis that full rhaSR activation requires CRP .	RI
11073923	164	We assayed the plasmid - borne lacZ fusions carrying these mutations to determine whether either of these two CRP sites was required for rhaSR activation .	RI
11073923	170	This suggests that CRP site 3 is responsible for at least part of the CRP activation of rhaSR expression .	RI
11073923	190	Taken together , our results suggest that CRP site 3 is the major site required for CRP activation of rhaSR expression .	RI
11073923	192	Since we now had evidence that CRP was a direct activator of rhaSR expression , we wished to determine whether AR1 and / or AR2 of CRP were necessary for this activation .	RI
11073923	197	Interestingly , these same three CRP mutants had similar small activation defects at the divergent rhaBAD promoter ( 14 ) .	RI
11073923	200	To more directly test for a role of - CTD in rhaSR activation , we assayed the effect of expressing a derivative of with the entire C - terminal domain deleted , - 235 ( 14 ) , on expression from several rhaSR promoter fusions .	RI
11073923	214	This result indicates that in the presence of RhaR , - CTD can contribute to transcription activation at rhaSR , perhaps by interaction with DNA and / or RhaR .	RI
11073923	218	To identify specific residues in - CTD that are involved in rhaSR activation , we assayed an - CTD plasmid library with independent alanine substitutions at each residue in - CTD ( 10 , 30 ) at the ( rhaS - lacZ ) 216 promoter fusion ( Fig . 3 ) .	RI
11073923	227	Effects of - CTD alanine substitution mutants on rhaSR activation .	RI
11073923	244	DISCUSSION CRP activates rhaSR from at least one newly identified binding site .	RI
11073923	246	Although there are many moderate to weak matches to the consensus CRP - binding site sequence in the rhaSR - rhaBAD intergenic region , three of these , sites 2 through 4 , seemed most likely to directly influence rhaSR activation .	RI
11073923	250	It is unlikely that CRP binding to site 4 contributes directly to an increase in rhaSR expression , since transcription activation by CRP requires that its binding site be on the same face of the DNA as the promoter ( 6 ) .	RI
11073923	285	Mechanism of activation by CRP at rhaSR .	RI
11073923	286	Clearly there is a component ( 13 - to 20 - fold ) to the activation by CRP at rhaSR that is independent of both - CTD and RhaR and hence does not function by the same mechanism used at simple class I CRP - dependent promoters , nor does it function through cooperative binding with RhaR .	RI
11073923	288	This component of CRP activation at rhaSR could account for the majority of the CRP activation in a wild - type context and may involve a mechanism , such as DNA bending , that can act from a distance .	RI
11073923	300	Role of - CTD in rhaSR activation .	RI
11073923	307	Alternatively , - CTD residues 321 , 322 , and 323 were defective at a rhaBAD promoter fusion that was activated only by the RhaS protein .	RI

11073923	558	Separate contributions of UhpA and CAP to activation of transcription of the uhpT promoter of Escherichia coli .	RI
1688950	13	Here , we show that purified RhaR can stimulate transcription from the pSr promoter , and that L - rhamnose is required for its activit ’ y .	RI
17513476	18	Given that cyclic AMP receptor protein ( CRP ) , the second activator required for full rhaBAD expression , cannot activate rhaBAD expression in a rhaS strain , it was of interest to test whether CRP could activate transcription in combination with RhaS - CTD .	RI
17513476	21	The RhaS protein functions to activate transcription of two of the operons in the Escherichia coli L - rhamnose regulon in response to the availability of L - rhamnose ( 11 , 40 ) .	RI
17513476	24	RhaR activates transcription of the operon that encodes the two activator proteins , rhaSR ( 37 , 38 ) .	RI
17513476	55	This domain alone could activate transcription of araBAD up to 15 % as well as full - length AraC when alone or to the same level as fulllength AraC when fused to an unrelated dimerization domain ( 7 , 36 ) .	RI
17513476	188	DNA sequence inspection and previous results indicating that RhaS was required for activation of rhaT expression ( 40 ) suggested that RhaS binds to DNA at the rhaT promoter , but direct evidence of RhaS protein binding to rhaT promoter DNA had not been obtained .	RI
17513476	202	Given that the activation by full - length , chromosomally expressed RhaS at rhaBAD is approximately 33 - fold higher than that of chromosomally expressed RhaR at rhaSR , comparable efficiencies of activation by the CTDs to their full - length counterparts would have resulted in His 6 - RhaR - CTD activating rhaSR by approximately 30 - fold .	RI
17513476	222	Two gels were prepared , with identical culture samples on each gel , and each blot was probed with the primary antibody corresponding to the purified protein samples loaded , as indicated to the right . - S , anti - RhaS antibody ; - R , anti - RhaR antibody . allow CRP to contribute to rhaBAD activation .	RI
17513476	233	Finally , at the ( rhaB - lacZ ) 110 fusion , which contains the CRP site required for full rhaBAD activation as well as the full RhaS binding site , there was a twofold contribution to activation by CRP when in combination with RhaS - CTD and a fivefold contribution to activation4990 WICKSTRUM ET AL . J .	RI
17513476	264	( B ) Transcription activation by RhaS expressed from the chromosome in SME1048 ( wild - type rhaSR ) .	RI
17513476	279	We found that CRP alone was not capable of activating rhaBAD expression , similar to previous findings in vivo , and that His 6 - RhaS - CTD alone substantially activated rhaBAD expression ( Fig . 6 ) .	RI
17513476	281	The threefold contribution to activation by CRP in this experiment is very similar to the twofold contribution found in the above in vivo experiment ( Table 3 ) , confirming that RhaS - CTD is sufficient to allow at least partial CRP activation of rhaBAD expression .	RI
17513476	282	This in vitro transcription system mimics the in vivo activation of rhaBAD by RhaS - CTD and also , to a great extent , the in vivo activation of rhaBAD by full - length RhaS , each in the presence and absence of CRP .	RI
17513476	755	Cyclic AMP receptor protein and RhaR synergistically activate transcription from the L - rhamnose - responsive rhaSR promoter in Escherichia coli .	RI
9393706	109	Thus , activation by Fis is dependent on the presence of MarA or Rob ( or induced levels of SoxS ; see below ) .	RI
9393706	123	In a strain with a wild - type chromosomal marRAB operon , Rob activates the promoter , and therefore the rob + mar + strain produces more MarR repressor than the rob mar + strain .	RI
9393706	125	For the marbox transversion mutants ( no . 7 and 8 ) which are insensitive to stimulation by Rob , the presence of Rob increases the transcription of the chromosomal marRAB promoter and therefore only increases the repression of the mutant fusions .	RI
9393706	130	In a similar experiment with a rob + mar strain , excess MarA stimulated mar transcription of a wild - type mar : : lacZ fusion by only 1.6 - fold ( 27 ) .	RI
9393706	135	However , induction of SoxS synthesis with 50 μm paraquat stimulated transcription of the wild - type mar promoter but not of the marbox promoter mutants 7 or 8 , whether they were in rob + mar or in rob mar strains ( Table 1 ) .	RI
9393706	136	This result again demonstrates that SoxS activation of the mar promoter is dependent on a functional marbox ( 27 ) .	RI
9393706	140	We previously demonstrated that in vitro transcriptional activation by MarA at the zwf promoter requires interaction with the carboxy - terminal domain of the α subunit of RNA polymerase ( 21 ) and inferred that MarA activates the mar promoter by enhancing the binding of RNA polymerase ( 27 ) .	RI
9393706	154	Whatever the mechanism for this apparent reduction in mar transcription by Fis , it cannot be the result of the specific repression of the mar operon , since the same reduction is observed whether or not the promoter is capable of binding Fis .	RI
9393706	171	We have considered three mechanisms for the activation by Fis of the mar promoter .	RI
9393706	196	Previously , overexpression of Rob was shown to induce multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance phenotypes ( 3 ) , to activate expression of fumC , inaA , and sodA in vivo ( 3 ) , and to activate the transcription of six mar / soxRS regulon promoters in vitro by mechanisms that are strikingly similar to that of MarA and SoxS ( 22 ) .	RI
9393706	218	The mar promoter is regulated by two independent mechanisms , transcriptional activation , depending on Fis and the MarA / Rob / SoxS activators , and repression due to MarR .	RI
12791142	14	We show here that the induction of the AcrAB efflux pump by decanoate and the more lipophilic unconjugated bile salts is mediated by Rob , and that the low - molecularweight inducers specifically bind to the C - terminal , non - DNA - binding domain of Rob .	RI
12791142	17	Thus , it is likely that E . coli is protecting itself by the Rob - mediated upregulation of AcrAB against the harmful effects of bile salts and fatty acids in the intestinal tract .	RI
12791142	73	Presumably , uninduced levels of MarA and / or SoxS mediate a low - level induction of the inaA gene ; the lower basal level of inaA expression in Dmar strains was noted earlier ( Rosner and Slonczewski , 1994 ) .	RI
12791142	121	The transcription of the marA gene is regulated by the repressor MarR ( Alekshun and Levy , 1997 ) .	RI
12791142	131	These results leave no doubt that AcrAB induction by fatty acids and lipophilic bile salts is mediated by the Rob protein and occurs with ecologically expected concentrations of these compounds .	RI

2182324	21	However , the hybrid mac promoters , containing only part of the lac promoter and the first lac operator , are just - 5 - fold repressed by Lac repressor ( Vidal - Ingigliari and Raibaud , 1985 ) .	RI
2182324	28	We show that cooperativity between the three lac operators , mediated through tetrameric Lac repressor , is crucial for repression of the lac operon . ( Oxford University Press 973S . Oehler et al . Results We constructed a set of eight plasmids , each encompassing the lacZ gene under control of the natural lac promoter and the three lac operators ( 01 , 02 and 03 ) either active or inactivated by site directed mutagenesis ( Figure 1 ) in all possible combinations .

2182324	95	Discussion Full repression of the lac operon requires both 02 and 03 Kania and Muller - Hill ( 1977 ) concluded from studies with a Lac repressor - fl - galactosidase chimera that two repressor subunits are sufficient for operator binding and that therefore tetrameric Lac repressor must be able to bind two lac operator sequences at the same time .	RI
2182324	148	To calculate the percentages of the various structures , we used the following information : ( i ) the wild - type lac operon is 1300 - fold repressed ; ( ii ) a lac operon in which 02 and 03 are destroyed is 18 - fold repressed , ( iii ) a lac operon in which O1 is destroyed is 2 - fold repressed , ( iv ) 02 and 03 have a 20 - and 100 - fold lower affinity for Lac repressor than O1 in vitro and ( v ) lac transcription is 50 - fold activated by CAP .

8626315	24	Moreover , they found that Rob overexpression activates expression of fumC , sodA , and inaA ( unknown function ) , but not zwf , and that purified Rob forms DNA - protein complexes with DNA fragments containing the micF , sodA , nfo , and zwf promoters ( 3 ) .	RI

8626315	81	Since we have shown previously that MalE - SoxS and MarA are sufficient for the in vitro transcriptional activation of the zwf , fpr , fumC , micF , nfo , and sodA promoters ( i . e . , additional factors are not required ) ( 18 , 19 ) , we conducted similar studies with purified Rob protein .

8626315	88	Coincidence of the sites for SoxS - and Rob - mediated activation of zwf transcription in vitro .	RI
8626315	92	Recently , we demonstrated that activation of in vitro zwf transcription by MalE - SoxS ( 18 ) , and by MarA as well ( 19 ) , requires this same DNA binding element and that this soxbox / marbox can bring in vitro gnd transcription under control of these two activators ( 18 , 19 ) .	RI
8626315	94	As with MalE - SoxS and MarA ( 18 , 19 ) , Rob stimulated in vitro transcription about threefold from the zwf promoter of templates Z1 , Z2 , Z3 , Z4 , and Z5 ( 9 ) , whose 5 ´ deletion end points reside at positions - 140 , - 86 , - 76 , - 67 , and - 62 , respectively ( Fig . 3A ) but failed to enhance transcription from construct Z6 , whose 5 ´ deletion end point lies at position - 57 ( 9 ) .

8522515	12	Like MalE - SoxS , MarA ( i ) activated the transcription of zwf , fpr , fumC , micF , nfo , and sodA ; ( ii ) required a 21 - bp " soxbox " sequence to activate zwf transcription ; and ( iii ) was " ambidextrous , " i . e . , required the C - terminal domain of the α subunit of RNA polymerase for activation of zwf but not fumC or micF .	RI
8522515	75	To determine whether the purified MarA protein affected gene expression , we tested its ability to activate the in vitro transcription of zwf , sodA , micF , and fumC , genes known to be under mar control in vivo , and of fpr and nfo , genes not known to be regulated by mar in vivo but activated by SoxS in vivo and by MalE - SoxS in vitro .	RI
8522515	110	Miller et al . ( 28 ) have found that SoxS activates mar transcription in vivo , and we have recently found a marbox sequence in the promoter region upstream of marRAB which binds MarA and enables either purified MalE - SoxS or MarA to activate transcription of marRAB in vitro ( 18 , 26 ) .

23010927	212	acrZ is regulated by MarA , Rob , and SoxS .	RI
21097628	27	This is likely due to the greater extent of activation by SoxS of promoters involved in superoxide defense , e . g . , acnA , fpr , zwf , fumC , and sodA .	RI
21097628	35	For example , MarA binds tightly to the marRAB promoter in vitro yet stimulates transcription by only ~ 3 - fold ; no significant binding to inaA can be demonstrated by gel shift experiments , yet transcription is stimulated &gt; 5 - fold .	RI
21097628	93	In every case , MarA ( E89A ) bound as well as or more tightly ( i . e . , had a lower K D [ equilibrium dissociation constant ) than WT MarA . For several promoter marboxes this change was dramatic : the K D dropped from &gt; &gt; 150 to 50 for inaA , from 200 to 75 for nfsB , and from &gt; &gt; 150 nM to ~ 100 nM for both ybjC and yhbW . In spite of this , MarA ( E89A ) activation was greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjC ; it was comparable to that of WT MarA for micF and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdaB , nfsB , and ybhW ( Table 3 and Fig . 1 ) . We conclude that the WT glutamic acid of MarA at position 89 is an inhibitor of MarA binding to many marboxes . In an effort to understand why E89 is inhibitory , we examined the sequences of the 14 marboxes for which we have data ( Table 3 ) . We noticed that five haveaTatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequences is increased by the E89A substitution ( less than 1.7 - fold ) . In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by &gt; 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA ( with aTatposition 12 ) indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position ( 36 ) , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue ( see the Discussion for a fuller treatment ) . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation ( see above ) . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA ( E89A ) ( with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain ) , MarA ( E89G ) ( with no side chain ) , MarA ( E89D ) ( with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid ) , MarA ( E89V ) ( with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , ) , WT SoxS , and SoxS ( V83E ) were introduced into these fusions and assayed for β - galactosidase . Again ( Table 2 ) , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , MarA ( E89A ) was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive ( indistinguishable from the control plasmid ) for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS ( V83E ) reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS ( V83E ) was still more active than WT MarA . ( The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in Table 2 appear smaller . ) As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , ( i ) that variant E89D is virtually inactive , ( ii ) that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , ( iii ) that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and ( iv ) that SoxS ( V83E ) has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated ( see Materials and Methods ) . Again ( Fig . 2 and Table 3 ) , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox ( Fig . 4 ) . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 ( Fig . 4A and B ) . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA ( Fig . 4B ) . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream ( between positions 9 and 10 ) was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed ( Fig . 4 ) although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA ( Q91A ) . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A ( Table 2 ) . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA ( Q91A ) activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels ( Table 2 ; see also below ) . For the nine class II promoters , MarA ( Q91A ) significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - ( Q91 ) has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence ( 36 ) . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site ( Q85 ) in SoxS ( 16 ) . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA ( Q91A ) relative to MarA ( Table 3 ) . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA ( Q91A ) showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA ( Q91A ) to the micF marbox ( using protein without the His 6 tag ) showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA ( Q91A ) to activate the class II micF promoter ( 13 ) . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA ( E89A ) . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA ( E89A ) to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate ( PMS ) and menadione ( Table 4 ) . Cells constitutively expressing MarA ( E89A ) were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS ( 1.7 - fold ) and , to a lesser extent , to menadione ( 1.3 - fold ) . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA ( E89A ) activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS ( MIC of 35 μM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA ) but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione ( MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT ) . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant ( acrAB , tolC , and micF ) and that defend against superoxide stress ( e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf ) ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 ) . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated ( 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 ) . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA . We think the following may explain these results . A detail of the MarA structure ( Fig . 5 ) shows that E89 is oriented in the cocrystal with its acidic groups exposed to the solvent away from the DNA backbone . In so doing , methyl hydrogens on the β - and - carbons are positioned restrictively close to an oxygen of the phosphate group between bases T12 and G13 of the marRAB marbox . Even this orientation of E89 is only possible as the result of a small “ clash ” ( as predicted by the MolProbity program [ http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / ] ) between E89 and S90 that permits the rotation of E89 into the MarA core and away from the DNA backbone .

16478729	26	It has been shown previously that all three transcriptional factors ( MarA , SoxS , and Rob ) regulate the expression of themselves ( 16 , 17 ) and each other ( 15 – 18 ) .	RI
16478729	28	Thus far , only the MarA / SoxS / Rob - binding site within the mar promoter has been identified and shown to be responsible for activation by all three transcription factors ( 17 ) .	RI
16478729	29	In contrast , the repression of both soxS and rob by SoxS , Rob , or MarA occurs via a yet to be identified binding site ( s ) within the sox and rob promoter regions ( 15 , 16 ) .	RI
16478729	106	Because previous studies have shown that the MarA - binding sites of two other repressed promoters ( hdeA and purA ) lie in a backward orientation ( 20 ) and either partially or completely overlap the - 35 hexamer , we examined whether the putative rob marbox might be in a similar configuration and position .	RI
16478729	159	However , in the presence of MarA the rob transcript levels decreased over time , but as expected the levels of the gnd transcript ( the control ) remained unaffected ( Fig . 6C ) .	RI

16478729	206	In contrast , in all three known examples of MarA - repressed genes ( hdeA , purA , and rob ) , the marbox is in the backward orientation and is proximal to or overlapping the RNAP - binding site ( see Fig . 8 ) .	RI

1474901	4	Summary Expression of the narK gene of Escherichia coli , like the narGHJI operon , is positively regulated by two frans - acting factors : Fnr , which is activated by anaerobic conditions , and NarL , which is activated by the presence of nitrate .	RI
1474901	17	Introduction The expression of respiratory nitrate reductase in Escherichia cotiis regulated at the level of transcription by two pleiotropic rrans - acting factors , Fnr and NarL ( Stewart , 1982 ) .	RI
1474901	19	NarL , activated in the presence of nitrate , modulates the pattern of anaerobic gene expression by inducing further the Fnr - dependent expression of formate dehydrogenase N ( Berg and Stewart , 1990 ) and nitrate reductase ( Stewart , 1982 ; Stewart and Parales , 1988 ) and by repressing the expression of the gene which encodes the fermentative enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase { Kalman and Gunsalus , 1988 ) as well as reductases for alternative electron acceptors , such as dimethylsulphoxide and fumarate ( luchi and Lin , 1987 ; Cotter and Gunsalus , 1989 ) , whose reductions are characterized by tower oxidation - reduction potentials .	RI
1474901	28	To explore the possible mechanisms involved in the integrated transcriptional activation by Fnr and NarL we have extended our studies to the c / s - acting regions required for expression of the narKgene , which encodes another component involved in nitrate respiration , a nitrate - nitrite antiporter ( Noji et ai , 1989 ; DeMoss and Hsu , 1991 ) .	RI
10601216	13	In addition , it was discovered that RpoS activates adhE transcription at both start sites .	RI
10601216	135	Thus , it seems that Fnr can regulate adhE expression from the downstream transcriptional start site only in the physical absence of the upstream region .	RI
11357510	233	Melville and Gunsalus ( 1996 ) reported that the hemA gene , which is also repressed by FNR , contains only one half - site of FNR consensus sequence .	RI
15225315	17	In previous work , we found that NarL or NarP activates the nir promoter by binding to a site centred at position - 69.5 and counteracting the repressive effects of IHF and Fis .	RI
15225315	19	We suggest that NarL interferes with IHF binding at the nir promoter by distorting the minor groove at its target site , and we argue that the resulting activation by NarL results from remodelling of the local nucleoprotein structure to facilitate FNR - dependent transcription .	RI
15225315	33	Recent studies have shown that transcription initiation at pnir is repressed by the binding of H - NS ( histone - like nucleoid structuring factor ) , IHF ( integration host factor ) and Fis ( factor for inversion stimulation ) ( Wu et al . , 1998 ; Browning et al . , 2000 ) , DNA - binding proteins that play a role in shaping the folded bacterial chromosome ( Azam and Ishihama , 1999 ) .	RI
15225315	47	The binding of Fis and IHF inhibits FNRdependent transcription at the nir promoter ( – ve ) .	RI
15225315	52	The binding of phospho - NarL / NarP displaces IHF from the IHF I site and remodels the architecture of the nir promoter , enabling FNRdependent transcription activation .	RI
15225315	75	Thus , although Fis and IHF repress FNR - dependent activation of pnir , they do not prevent FNR binding .	RI
15225315	77	IHF bound to the IHF II site activates FNR - dependent transcription Previously , we demonstrated that IHF binding to the IHF I site represses FNR - dependent transcription at pnir ( Wu et al . , 1998 ; Browning et al . , 2000 ) .	RI
15225315	129	This suggests that occupation of the IHF II site increases FNR - dependent activation of pnir .	RI
15225315	133	As expected , the introduction of the p99G and p146A substitutions derepressed expression from the wild - type promoter , confirming that IHF and Fis binding to the IHF I and Fis I sites represses pnir .	RI
15225315	154	NarL , FNR and Fis can bind to pnir together , but NarL interferes with the binding of IHF To investigate the mechanism by which NarL counteracts IHF - and Fis - mediated repression at pnir , we used gel retardation assays and DNase I footprinting to examine the binding of NarL , FNR , Fis and IHF .	RI
15225315	223	As the NarL / NarP binding site at pnir overlaps with the IHF I site ( Fig . 3 ) , NarL / NarP might compete with IHF , and this would provide a simple mechanism by which NarL / NarP could counteract IHFmediated repression .	RI

RI
22465792	79	Again , with the use of the criterion for a significant effect of a substitution as one that reduces transcription to &lt; 80 % of that produced by wild - type 70 , none of the library ’ s substitutions significantly reduced Robdependent transcription activation of the three class II promoters ( i . e . , fumC , micF , and inaA ) ( Fig . 2a – c ) .	RI
22465792	80	In our previous work with the tri - alanine scanning library , we also determined that several members of the library reduced SoxS - dependent activation of transcription from the class I fpr promoter , as expected , because the SoxS binding site of class I promoters lies upstream of the 35 hexamer , which is therefore exposed and available for binding by 70 R4 .	RI
22465792	82	The experiments in Fig . 2a – c suggest that the binding of Rob to the robboxes of the fumC , micF , and inaA promoters occludes the binding of 70 R4 to the 35 hexamer of these class II promoters , as is also the case during SoxS - dependent activation of the fumC and micF promoters .	RI
22465792	94	20 - 22,39 Indeed , changing C5 to any of the other three nucleotides severely reduces SoxS - dependent transcription activation of the fpr and zwf promoters .	RI

8995231	163	The binding of two dimers of IciA protein to the IciA I site , which is located 50 to 63 nucleotides from the transcription start site of dnaA promoter 1P , is required to stimulate RNA polymerase binding to the 1P promoter .	RI
8995231	167	Our previous experiments have shown that when both dnaA promoters 1P and 2P were repressed by DnaA protein , IciA protein specifically activated transcription from dnaA promoter 1P , while dnaA promoter 2P was still repressed ( 25 ) .	RI

2419307	10	The metBL and metF genes each had a single transcript which was repressed by metj , while the metJ gene had three transcripts , of which the first was strongly repressed by metj , the second was less strongly repressed , and the third was not repressed .	RI
2419307	16	The metJ gene product exists as a dimer with an Mr of 24,000 and has been shown to bind specifically , in vitro , to the region of DNA between metJ and metBL and to the DNA near the metF promoter , causing repression of all four genes ( 24 , 26 ) .	RI
2419307	103	Thus , the single chromosomal copy of metJ in JJ100 produces enough product to cause about a 35 - fold repression of the multiple , plasmid - borne metB promoters .	RI

2419307	196	It appears that binding of the metJ gene product may prevent binding of RNA polymerase to the metB and Jl promoters and , under strongly repressing conditions , may also decrease the binding to the J2 promoter .	RI
2419307	209	Our results confirm that metJ is autoregulated and demonstrate that much of the regulation is indeed at the level of transcription ( i . e . , repression of the Jl and J2 promoters ) .	RI
7545108	62	There are two NagC operator sites upstream of gimU The perfect inverse correlation between the induction of nag and repression of glm genes posed the question as to whether the regulation of glmU expression involved the NagC protein .	RI
7545108	151	An alternative explanation is that repression occurs by the ' roadblock ' mechanism described for PurR repression of the purB promoter ( He and Zalkin , 1992 ) .	RI
7545108	154	It is interesting to compare the characteristics of NagCmediated repression of nag degradative genes with the NagC - mediated activation of the glm genes .	RI
7545108	171	Expression of the FNR - dependent nitrate regulon is further activated by NarL binding to an upstream site , situated 70 - 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site , depending upon the promoter ( reviewed in Stewart , 1993 ) .	RI
7545108	173	Although the proximal site , BoxGl , is located at a position typical of prokaryotic activators ( Collado - Vides et al . , 1991 ; Gralla , 1991 ) , it is not sufficient to allow NagC to to activate glmU by itself ; this could be because NagC occupation of this lower affinity site is inadequate in the absence of the higher affinity upstream site .	RI
7545108	179	The AraC protein activates and represses the araBAD genes , depending upon the presence of the inducer and cAMP / CAP which change the occupancy of the different sites ( Reeder and Schleif , 1993 and references therein ) .	RI
17238917	9	In contrast , IHF does not enhance the ability of NanR to activate fimB expression in the wild - type background .	RI
17238917	11	However , placing the NanR , IHF and NagC binding sites closer to the fimB promoter enhances the ability of the regulators to activate fimB expression .	RI
17238917	86	Taken together , these results support a model in which O NC2 enhances the binding of NagC to O NC1 , with the two sites functioning jointly to control fimB expression .	RI
17238917	87	Scanning - replacement mutagenesis of the region separating O NC1 from O NC2 and the effect of IHF on fimB expression Although the results described above show that O NC1 and O NC2 function together , the distance between the centre of the two operators ( 212 bp ) is longer than for any other NagC - regulated operon .	RI
17238917	122	To investigate how IHF activates fimB expression further , the IHF binding site mutation described above was combined with those in O NC1 , O NC2 and O NR alone , and O NC1 O NR in combination , and the expression of the FimB – LacZ chimera was measured ( Fig . 6 ) .	RI
17238917	130	The wild - type ( W + ) and mutant strains indicated were analysed as in the legend to Fig . 2A . © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 63 , 1223 – 1236Regulation of fimB by Neu 5Ac and GlcNAc 1229 lower level of fimB expression , as would be expected if it prevents activation by both NagC and NanR .	RI
17238917	134	This suggests that IHF binding to ibs has a small inhibitory effect on the ability of NanR to activate fimB expression .	RI
17238917	138	Taking these results together with those presented above , it is concluded that the cooperative interaction of NagC bound to O NC1 and O NC2 , with IHF bound to the site identified in this work , forms a nucleoprotein complex that activates fimB expression .	RI
17238917	143	Thus , NanR and NagC appear to activate fimB expression independently .	RI
17238917	144	Accordingly we reasoned that a loss of fimB expression as a result of decreased NagC activity in the D3 background might be compensated for by enhanced activation by NanR for some reason .	RI
17238917	158	It thus seems likely that the ability of IHF alone to activate fimB expression is enhanced in the D3 mutant background .	RI
17238917	161	Thus the D3 region is not apparently required for NanR to activate fimB expression in the wildtype background , and it could contain specific sequences that inhibit this .	RI
17238917	174	While the basis for this effect is uncertain , it is nevertheless evident that neither NanR nor NagC requires the wild - type segment of D7 DNA in order to be able to activate fimB expression .	RI
17238917	176	To test this hypothesis further , and to examine the effect of operator - to - promoter distance on NagC activation , the effect of deleting the 274 bp region ( D7 ) described above on fimB expression was also analysed ( Fig . 8 ) .	RI
17238917	177	The results of this analysis confirm this assertion , and show additionally that NagC is also better able to We previously presented evidence suggesting that the D2 region , and hence NanR and NagC , could activate fimB expression by blocking the inhibitory effect of additional cis - acting element ( s ) positioned closer to nanC ( El - Labany et al . , 2003 ) .	RI
17238917	183	Discussion We showed in earlier work that fimB expression , and hence the OFF - to - ON phase switching of type 1 fimbriation , is activated by NanR and NagC and hence repressed Fig . 9 .	RI
17238917	187	NanR and NagC activate fimB expression by binding to operator sequences ( O NR and O NC1 respectively ; Fig . 1 ) situated further upstream of the regulated promoter than is usual in bacteria .	RI
17238917	189	Furthermore , as NagC binding to O NC1 prevents CRP - dependent activation of nanC ( Condemine et al . , 2005 ) , this study should enhance our understanding of the regulation of this gene as well .	RI
17238917	196	Considered together , these data show that IHF promotes an interaction between NagC bound to O NC1 and O NC2 , forming a stable nucleoprotein complex that activates fimB expression .	RI
17238917	199	Thus , not only does IHF stimulate both FimB and FimE recombination , as well as activate fimbrial expression in phase ON cells , but it is now clear that it enhances fimB expression too .	RI
17238917	212	Thus , activation of fimB expression by NanR , as judged by the effect of mutations in nanR , orin its operator sequence ( O NR ) , is enhanced considerably in the D3 deletion mutant .	RI
17238917	213	This observation not only allows us to understand how a modest mutation in O NC2 can affect fimB expression whereas the D3 mutation does not , but it also supports our prior assertion that NanR activates fimB expression without NagC ( Sohanpal et al . , 2004 ) .	RI
17238917	214	The results described above also suggest that when O NR is placed closer to the fimB promoter , NanR is better able to activate fimB expression , and further work supports this idea .	RI
17238917	216	By replacing the 274 bp of wild - type DNA from - 467 to - 194 with heterologous sequences it was shown that neither NanR nor NagC requires this segment of DNA in order to activate fimB expression .	RI
17238917	221	NagC is best characterized as a repressor ( Plumbridge , 2001 ; Plumbridge and Pellegrini , 2004 ) , although the regulator does activate one of the glmUS operon promoters albeit by binding at the more conventional position of - 47 relative to the transcriptional start site ( Plumbridge , 1995 ) .	RI
17238917	222	At the moment we do not know how NagC activates the fimB promoter , but two general scenarios seem most plausible .	RI
17238917	234	We note that such an effect is not unprecedented for a member of the GntR / FadR family of transcriptional regulators like NanR ( Rigali et al . , 2002 ; Kalivoda et al . , 2003 ) ; activation of the glcDEFGB operon by GlcC and IHF is thought to occur in this way , with IHF bound to a site between the promoter and a distant ( &gt; - 170 bp ) upstream activating site for GlcC ( Pellicer et al . , 1999 ) .	RI
17238917	236	Thus , if the model proposed above is correct , it seems probable that NanR must make contact with RNA polymerase , or another regulatory factor bound closer to the promoter , in order to activate fimB expression in the wild - type background as well .	RI
17238917	454	( 2004 ) Expression of the chitobiose operon of Escherichia coli is regulated by three transcription factors : NagC , ChbR and CAP .	RI
15534208	140	The identification of NagC as an activator of fimB expression indicated that the expression of the recombinase would be inhibited by GlcNAc .	RI

15534208	178	fimE is regulated by the fim invertible element , and hence , like the Pap adhesin regulators PapB and PapI , both of the fim regulatory proteins are probably controlled by phase variation as well ( 48 , 49 ) .	RI
1848637	276	Expression of both nagE and nagB was shown to be stimulated by CAP in viva , although nagE was much more dependent than nagB ( Plumbridge , 1990 ) .	RI
1848637	326	In experiments using native nag DNA , both sites are of DNA looping was reinforced by the strict phasing requirement of the AraC binding sites for repression of the araBAD operon ( Dunn et al . , 1984 ; Lee &amp; Schleif , 1989 ) .	RI
1848637	359	The simultaneous binding of repressor and activator type proteins to nag DNA implies two corollaries : ( 1 ) NagC does not repress by competition with CAP and ( 2 ) CAP does not activate by displacing NagC .	RI
